Word of his presence spread to the Latics players and following their 3-0 derby thumping of neighbours Rochdale on Tuesday night they invited them into a celebrating dressing room.

Good look to you for the rest of the season.' The victory lifted Oldham to 11th in League One, four points outside the play-offs with eight matches to go.

However, for the 37-year-old owner of Surf Simply, a surfing resort in Nosara, the sport was an early love that blossomed later in life. He first paddled out to the big blue when he was a teenager, but his professional life took a different turn when he embarked on a fine art degree in London. In the end, the pull of the waves was too strong and Hill decamped to Costa Rica with a goal to create a surfing school with a difference. \"I wanted to create a really intimate space that was a long way away from the putting the lots of people in the water kind of business model that surf schools often are. I wanted to just have a few people, 12 people each week, and then this area is somewhere where they can completely decompress and just focus on being coached how to surf better,\" he says. A large chunk of the school's training is devoted to theory classes, and Hill also films his students while they're surfing so that he can show them what aspects of their technique they need to improve: \"The first time you see yourself surfing, it's kind of mortifying. It's a little bit like hearing yourself sing for the first time. But, like most sports, it's the best coaching tool we have,\" he says. Hill's fine art credentials have not gone to waste though, as his creative training helped him design the website as well as the resort logo. While following his passion for surfing was important, Hill stresses that figuring out how to make money out of it was equally significant. \"The business side of it has to work, the numbers have to make sense. Otherwise, what you've got is a brilliant hobby that's not a business,\" he says. Hill says that, while he feels fortunate that his work fulfills him, it still involves ordinary tasks that can sometimes be mundane. \"I don't think anyone is going to find a job that they love all the time, but if you can find something that you love most of the time, you're luckier than most people in the world.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nRu Hill trained in fine art in London .\nHowever, his heart was in surfing and he opened a surf retreat in Costa Rica .\nHe says following a passion is important, but it has to make financial sense ."}

The France international struggled to settle in during his first 18 months after arriving from Paris Saint-Germain for £18million in the summer of 2013. He made 24 appearances in his first season but never really looked comfortable and this campaign started even worse as he walked out of Anfield after not being selected for September's Merseyside derby and then sustained a thigh injury which sidelined him for three months. Mamadou Sakho (right) says learning the English language has helped him improve at Liverpool . However, since returning in mid-December he has been a virtual ever-present, missing just five matches with another injury, and has made a noticeable improvement. The 25-year-old puts much of that down to him learning English. 'Do I finally feel happy at Liverpool? Yes, I feel good. The most difficult thing has been the language,' he told L'Equipe. 'I am a man of strong character so when I can't express myself I am always frustrated, and if I cannot make myself understood it is even worse. The French centre back has been an ever present for Liverpool in the second half of the season . 'Some people said that I should be speaking French and that would allow me to release the tension a bit, except that when I spoke in French on the pitch nobody understood what I was saying. 'I said to myself: 'This is useless - I really must learn'. It took time but now it is very good.' Sakho has put his fit of pique ahead of the first derby this season behind him and is grateful fans appear to have forgiven him also. 'I said sorry - it is all over,' he added. 'In England the supporters don't hold a grudge. In France, especially, it was talked about a lot negatively.'

The 2010 international player of the year was taken to hospital for X-rays after being hurt during the Dragons' 40-40 draw with Salford in Perpignan on Saturday. It was only Carney's second appearance in Super League after joining the Catalans on a three-year contract. Catalan Dragons' Todd Carney is expected to be out of acton for three to four weeks with a broken rib . Carney was taken to hospital for X-rays after damaging his ribs during match against Salford . Referee Phil Bentham ruled that Salford forward Lama Tasi was committed to the tackle on the Australian stand-off but the incident infuriated Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous, who insists the Red Devils player should have been punished and expects him to be charged when the Rugby Football League's match-review panel study the incident on Monday. Frayssinous was fiercely critical earlier this season of what he claimed was a failure of referees to protect his playmakers and in particular full back Morgan Escare and expressed his fears that Carney would become a target. 'I said I was worried over the protection of my quality players and it has happened in only his second game,' Frayssinous said. 'I expect Tasi to be charged but I also thought he should have been shown a card.' Frayssinous was also angered by the decision of Bentham to penalise Escare in the closing moments for playing on after being tackled near his own line. That enabled Josh Griffin to draw the match but Frayssinous said his full-back should have been allowed to go back and play the ball and expects his critical post-match comments, in which he accused officials of double standards, to result in a fine. 'I hope that my £500 will help the referee to be better next week,' he said.

How? By a 124-year-old patent from 22 December 1891 which clearly illustrates an 'over' arrangement for toilet paper. Writer Owen Williams discovered the toilet paper patent online, and wasted no time in sharing his new-found information with his 8,000 followers on Twitter. The in-depth patent created by New York businessman Seth Wheeler clearly shows an 'over' arrangement . The patent was created by the inventor of perforated toilet paper sheets, New York business man Seth Wheeler. Wheeler, who was also the owner of the Albany Perforated Wrapping Sheet Company, undoubtedly innovated the way toilet paper is created and used in this way. Included in the patent, are Seth's declarations on his new product: 'Be it known that I, SETH WHEELER, of the city and county of Albany, and State of New York, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Toilet-Paper Rolls.' Although there's no specific mention of the 'over' arrangement of the toilet paper, the diagram is a solid confirmation of the correct use. And it's not just the over-under toilet paper debate that gets homemakers agitated; it's the state of the entire bathroom. Other key things to consider? Cleanliness. Etiquette expert William Hanson said as well as making sure toilet rolls sit 'over', other bathroom tidiness is important: ‘I very much judge a house, and the house owner, by the state of their guest bathroom. ‘I would question the hygiene of the person's kitchen if the loo wasn’t spotless upon arrival. Finally, the age-old argument about which way a toilet roll should sit in a bathroom has been resolved . ‘My own facilities for guests are half bathroom, half temple. ‘There’s no streaky chrome, or chipped wooden loo seats for heaven-knows what germs to fester. ‘If a guest doesn’t come out the lavatory and comment on its condition then I feel I have failed as a host; so many over-worry about their food, spending hours faffing with reproducing some stack, tower or jus they saw in an over-priced nouvelle cuisine joint, when really they should have spent the time having a whizz round with the Harpic.’", "completion": "response:\n\nThe argument that usually divides households has been settled via Twitter .\nAccording to Seth Wheeler, the man who invented toilet roll, it's 'over'\nWriter Owen Williams found the 1891 patent and tweeted to followers ."}

Jardim, whose side beat the Gunners on away goals in the last 16 of the competition, said Wenger left for the changing rooms early rather than shaking his hands after the Ligue 1 side's impressive 3-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg. The Portuguese boss thus decided not to thank the 65-year-old following Arsenal's 2-0 victory in the return fixture. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim reacts on the pitch at the end of their Champions League win on away goals . Arsene Wenger said he wanted to shake Leonardo Jardim's hand at the final whistle but he was celebrating . The Monaco coach claims he did so as Wenger didn't congratulate him after the first-leg victory . Speaking after their progression to the quarter-finals, Jardim said: 'In the first leg, when I wanted to thank Arsene and shake his hand, it's true that Arsene didn't shake my hand, so even though Monaco did everything to make life comfortable for Arsenal tonight, I decided not to thank him. 'I think it was disrespectful. Right now, we're celebrating and we think Arsenal did not show enough respect during the first leg.' Wenger though insists such claims are lies, and says Jardim was too busy celebrating with his team to notice that the Arsenal boss had waited to congratulate him in north London.

So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League.

Falcao, on a season-long loan at Old Trafford from Monaco, has been a huge disappointment having notched just four goals in 20 appearances since moving to the Barclays Premier League. A series of poor performances have seen him left out of Louis van Gaal's side of late and with Monaco expecting a fee for around £40million for the former Atletico Madrid striker in the summer, United face a tough decision over his future. Radamel Falcao has been a disappointment at Manchester United and it looks unlikely that they will sign him . Ray Wilkins cannot see United taking up the option of signing Falcao with the way his form has been . Van Gaal seems so disappointed in the forward that he left him on the bench away at Newcastle United on Wednesday night - even when United were desperate for a goal in the closing stages. And former United midfielder Wilkins feels that Falcao's days are numbered after failing to convince the club to invest even more money in him. 'Falcao has been struggling for goals,' Wilkins told talkSPORT. 'He hasn't shown any type of form that we expected when he arrived at Manchester United.' Falcao chases down a ball at Old Trafford, but he has recently found himself benched by Louis van Gaal . Sunderland defender Patrick van Aanholt gets to grips with Falcao, who has struggled for form in England . The 29-year-old cost Monaco over £40m when signed a year-and-half ago from Atletico Madrid, where he forged a reputation as a goalscorer and netted a hat-trick against Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup in 2012. But Wilkins says he is nowhere near the standards that he showed at that game in Monaco. 'His form has been very poor in fact, we haven't seen anything like the player who absolutely destroyed Chelsea with Atletico Madrid a few years back,' he said. 'They have already paid a huge loan fee and his wages are extremely expensive. To take him on would require a big fee, I would think they will look elsewhere.'

Tiffany Two's owner Sharon Voorhees said she paid just $10 for the cat when she bought her from a pet store at six weeks old. She boasts that it was the 'best money she ever spent.' According to the Guinness World Records the short-haired black and orange tortoiseshell is officially the world's oldest living cat. Voorhees recalls that at the time she bought Tiffany Two she also purchased two dogs, born around the same time, but they died years ago. Meanwhile, she explains that the cat's unusual name was  a tribute to another tortoiseshell cat she owned in the 1970s. And while the 27-year-old is generally in good health, she does suffer from high blood pressure.

The British driver and his team-mate Kevin Magnussen, who is deputising for the injured Fernando Alonso, endured a miserable day during practice for the season opener at the Albert Park Circuit. The McLaren pair, hampered by reliability problems to their new Honda engine, managed only 13 laps between them in Friday’s opening session and were five seconds down on Nico Rosberg’s best time for Mercedes. Jenson Button cut a frustrated figure in Melbourne on Friday as McLaren struggled for pace and reliability . Button was almost four seconds slower than Nico Rosberg, who set the pace for Mercedes on Friday . And while Button managed to get more running under his belt during the second session, completing 21 laps, he was still almost four seconds down on the front-running Mercedes. Magnussen posted four laps before losing control of his McLaren at Turn Six and crashing into the barriers. Backmarkers Manor, who didn’t compete at any of the winter tests, failed to take to the track on Friday, and Button fears a similar no-show tomorrow will see McLaren bring up the rear for Sunday’s curtain raiser in Melbourne. Kevin Magnussen loses control of his McLaren at Turn Six and runs into the gravel before crashing out . The Dane didn't take any further part in the session with his car in bits before it was taken back to the garage . ‘I am hoping it won’t be the last row of the grid,’ said Button, a three-time winner in Melbourne, when asked about his hopes for qualifying. ‘Hopefully 20 cars will run. It won’t be easy and we all know it. We are working as one and we are not pointing any fingers. We are just solving the problems as we go. Hopefully we will be competitive sooner rather than later.’ McLaren, powered by Honda for the first time since 1992, had a pre-season to forget as they struggled for pace and reliability. And getting to the chequerd flag on Sunday will now be considered a positive result for a team which hasn’t tasted victory in over two years. ‘I have no goals in terms of position,’ said Button. ‘The important thing is to make sure we maximise everything we have and then look at timesheets in qualifying and the race, see how we fared, and how much work we have to do.’ McLaren are powered by Honda this year, but face an uphill struggle and may bring up the rear in Melbourne .", "completion": "response:\n\nJenson Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen were well off the pace .\nThey were four seconds slower than Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton .\nAnd Button fears McLaren will bring up the rear in qualifying .\nMcLaren are also struggling for reliability and may not make the finish ."}

Ryanair, the Ireland-based budget carrier, plans to run services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing from as little as $15. The idea is part of an aggressive growth strategy, connecting airports such as London Stansted and Berlin with New York, Boston and Miami. Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, has received board approval to develop a transatlantic service for budget passengers, with one-way tickets between the US and key European cities costing as little as $15 . The airline first mooted the idea of offering transatlantic flights back in 2008 and board approval comes after the airline has invested 18 months in cleaning up its image and improving customer service. It is believed it could take up to five years to realize the plan, as the airline needs to source appropriate long-haul aircraft for the routes. Last year, Michael O’Leary, the airline’s chief executive, told the Irish Hotels Federation conference in Meath that Ryanair would offer the $15 flights to Boston and New York. However, he admitted that passengers would pay extra for everything from meals to baggage. He said: 'We can make money on 99 cent fares in Europe. Michael O'Leary  previously said the airline has long been looking at long-haul flight plans, but is held back by a lack of aircraft availability . 'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats.' In a separate conversation, Mr O'Leary admitted: 'We've had a business plan ready to roll for a transatlantic, low-fares airline. 'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.' Sir Freddie Laker revolutionised air travel with his idea for budget flights between Europe and the US, but his airline failed in 1982 . Ryaniar isn't the only airline to consider offering budget transatlantic flights. Previously, Sir Freddie Laker launched Skytrain in the late Seventies to offer 'no frills' flights to the US, but his carrier Lake Airways failed in 1982. Zoom Airlines tried a similar concept in 2002 but was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2008.

Scientists believe the gene tells fat to gather around the middle, rather than the bottom and thighs. In other words, it influences whether someone is an ‘apple’, with a big tummy, or a ‘pear’, who widens out below the waist. It raises the possibility of pills that stop fat from being stored around the waist – meaning an end to pot bellies and muffin tops. Apple-shaped: Scientists have discovered that a gene called Plexin D1 influences whether a person is an 'apple', with a big belly, or a 'pear' with fat on their hips and thighs . And the benefits wouldn’t just be cosmetic. The discovery of the ‘apple-shape’ gene is important because being an ‘apple’ who stores fat around the middle is worse for health than being a ‘pear’. Unlike the fat that pads out pear-shapes, belly fat wraps around the body’s vital organs and produces hormones and other chemicals that tamper with blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar levels. As a result it raises the risk of a host of health problems including heart disease, diabetes and strokes. To get to the bottom of how fat is stored, the US researchers studied zebra fish, tiny tropical fish whose transparent bodies make it see their inner workings. By using a dye that turned fat cells fluorescent, they showed that fish without a gene called Plexin D1 stored less fat around their abdomen than usual. Muffin top: Fat around the middle is dangerous to health as it wraps itself around vital organs, and raises the risk of health problems including heart disease, diabetes and strokes . Instead, the fat was stored in more a pear-shaped pattern, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. The fish without apple-shape gene were also better at processing sugar – something that should cut the odds of diabetes. With the Plexin-1 gene thought to have a similar role in people, the research paves the way for a drug that stops people from growing big bellies. Researcher Dr James Minchin, of Duke University, in North Carolina, said that this could also be good for health.", "completion": "response:\n\nPlexin D1 gene influences whether a person is 'apple' or 'pear' shaped .\nDiscovery raises possibility of pills to stop fat being stored on the belly .\nUnlike fat  on hips and thighs, belly fat wraps itself around vital organs .\nRaises risk of illnesses including heart disease, diabetes and stroke ."}

The auction house is offering an untitled work by Italian sculptor Maurizio Cattelan that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are English -- every defeat suffered by the England team between 1874 and 1998. Cattelan has carved all the defeats into a large (and it would have to be, wouldn't it?) piece of black granite, meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings. The artist says of his memorial stone-style work simply: \"I guess it's a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death.\" Known for his humorous and satirical art, Cattelan had plenty to work with as he recorded defeats starting with a 2-1 loss to Scotland in Glasgow in 1874 and ending with another 2-1 setback against Romania at the 1998 World Cup. Since then, of course, he'd have had a fair few more to immortalize, including the two to Italy and Uruguay in Brazil last summer that were part of the worst-ever England display at a World Cup. The artist, whose other works include La Nona Ora (The Ninth Hour), which depicts Pope John Paul II being struck down by a meteorite, first put his football piece on display at an exhibition in London in 1999. It's not known whether any England managers and players, past or present, came along to have a sneaky look. Current England boss Roy Hodgson is known to be a bit of an Italophile, but the former Inter Milan coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- Cattelan's work is on public exhibition at Sotheby's New Bond Street galleries until Tuesday 10 March.

Neither of the owners, from St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, turned up to the hearing, and so were sentenced in their absence to a multitude of animal welfare offences. Rosemary was also given a community order for six months, a six month curfew and made to pay £1,063 costs and fines. Rachel was handed a 12-month community order, 100 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay £763 in costs and fines. The RSPCA was called with concern in February after George was finally taken to a vet.

The Hong Kong-bound plane sat at its gate at a Bangkok airport for an extra 30 minutes while the family, flight attendants and other travellers were involved in a heated stand-off. Most airlines allow children under two to sit on a parent’s lap during take-off and landing. Any child over that age must sit in their own seat and wear a safety belt. The boy's father (middle) rowed with other passengers, putting the flight 30 minutes behind schedule . In last Thursday’s incident, the boy refused to take his seat and wear a seatbelt moments before flight CX654 was scheduled to take off from Suvarnabhumi Bangkok International Airport, a passenger, named Lau, told Hong Kong’s Apple Daily newspaper. All other passengers were seated and prepared for their two-hour journey. Flight attendants asked the family to put the boy in his seat and buckle his safety belt, but the parents refused to obey their directions and insisted that the boy be allowed to sit on his mother’s lap, the South China Morning Post reported. A passenger recorded the argument that followed and shared the video with Apple Daily. A female passenger urged cabin crew to call police after the family refused to get off the plane . In the video, the boy’s defiant father said: ‘If others keep on harassing us, then we will not leave.’ A female passenger, speaking in Cantonese, urged cabin crew to call police, adding: ‘We are customers too. Why are you two allowed to harass all the passengers on board?’ The boy’s father, speaking Putonghua, refused to stand down, saying: ‘If you keep on talking, we won’t leave.’ Moments later, the boy’s mother carries the crying child off the plane as the father collects their belongings. In a similar incident, police were called after a couple refused to place their grandson in his seat . Cathay Pacific defended its decision, telling the South China Morning Post that it was based on safety grounds. A day before, police were called to Hong Kong International Airport after a three-year-old boy would not remain in his seat on a Hong Kong Airlines flight that arrived from Bali, Indonesia, the newspaper reported.

Joanna Leigh claims the indictment is retribution for her vocal criticism of the way One Fund Boston disbursed the funds. Authorities say Leigh, 41, collected almost $40,000 from One Fund and other sources after claiming to have suffered a brain injury during the attack. They say she received $8,000 payment from One Fund Boston, which was set up to compensate bombing victims. She's also accused of receiving $1,700 from a school fundraiser, collecting more than $9,000 in contributions from an online fundraiser and getting more than $18,000 in benefits from the Massachusetts Victims for Violent Crime compensation fund. The indictment says she also accepted free medical treatment. No one is contesting that Leigh was at the marathon on April 15, 2013, the day of the attack. But Boston Police and Suffolk County investigators say she wasn't hurt. She apparently did not claim any injury or seek any medical treatment until about two weeks later. \"When she did begin to make those claims, she billed herself as a 'hero' who ran toward the second blast,\" authorities said. Leigh says the indictment is payback for her criticism of One Fund. She and others have claimed they weren't properly compensated by the fund because of the way it calculated payments. If someone's injury didn't require an overnight hospital stay, he or she received $8,000. Those who were hospitalized got $125,000 or more. \"I don't think this is about me; I think this is because I spoke out about The One Fund,\" she told the Boston Globe on Thursday. \"I think this is about killing the messenger.\" Leigh will be arraigned Monday.

On Wednesday, lawmakers in Ireland rushed to close a loophole that temporarily made it legal to possess Ecstasy, crystal methamphetamine, ketamine, magic mushrooms and a host of other recreational drugs. The loophole was inadvertently opened the day before, when an appeals court invalidated one section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The court ruled that Irish governments had been unconstitutionally adding substances to Section 2 of the law for decades. \"We prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet,\" Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said in a written statement. \"The emergency legislation ... will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment.\" The emergency law moved through the Irish legislature and was signed by the President on Wednesday, meaning that the drugs would become illegal to possess again at midnight, a Department of Health spokeswoman told CNN. Varadkar said the temporarily legalized substances -- which include a wide array of synthetic or \"head shop\" drugs -- \"all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits,\" according to the Irish Times. The original schedule of substances listed in the 1977 law -- including cannabis, cocaine and heroin -- were untouched by the appeals court ruling and remained illegal. Varadkar also told the Irish Times that the court ruling could affect \"dozens\" of cases, although The Journal of Ireland said the court's decision will affect only cases now in the judicial process.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe president signs emergency legislation .\nThe loophole opened when an appeals court struck down part of Ireland's drug law ."}

Menendez, 33, was allowed Friday to plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter, Brown said in a statement. The judge indicated he would sentence her to 22 to 25 years in prison on April 29. Conviction on the original charge would have resulted in a tougher sentence -- 25 years to life imprisonment, Meris Campbell, spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said Saturday. The district attorney's office accepted the plea because Menendez promised not to appeal and because of Menendez's \"substantial psychiatric history and serious drug problem,\" Campbell said. \"We are assured she'll serve a substantial amount of time behind bars.\" The victim, Sunando Sen, 46, was not Muslim.

The grocery store, Monoprix, was doing some renovations in January and workers removing an underground wall discovered the bones. The area was apparently part of a cemetery for the Hospital of the Trinity, according to CNN affiliate, France's BFM-TV. The cemetery operated from the 12th century to around the 17th century. Researchers and archeologists are conducting carbon dating and DNA testing to try to figure out when and why the people died, the affiliate said. It's clear they all died around the same time, lead archeologist Isabelle Abadie told BFM-TV, because of the way the bodies were neatly arranged. \"What's surprising is the bodies were not thrown in (the graves) but were carefully placed there in an organized manner. The individuals, men, women, and children, were placed head-to-toe,\" to fit as many as possible in the grave, Abadie explained. Paris suffered several plague epidemics during the times that the hospital was in operation, as well as a smallpox outbreak in the 17th century. Archeologists working the site have found eight common graves in an area that is 100 square meters, with seven of the graves containing between five and 20 skeletons each and another site with more than 150 skeletons, BFM-TV said. The groupings suggest that whole families were buried together.

We're ecstatic to give them the next thrilling chapter of Mulder and Scully they've been waiting for,\" Fox executives Dana Walden and Gary Newman said in a statement. Anderson wasted no time in tweeting the news. \"The X-Files\" concerned Mulder, an FBI agent who believes in paranormal phenomena, and Scully, who served as a check on his impulses. The series produced some memorable characters -- particularly the Smoking Man, a key focal point of the series' various conspiracy theories -- and resulted in two movies. Vince Gilligan, who later created \"Breaking Bad,\" got his start on \"The X-Files\" and occasionally paid tribute to the show on his later series. Show creator Chris Carter, who will also oversee the new series, said he thought of the hiatus between 2002, when the \"X-Files\" went off the air, and this year as \"a 13-year commercial break.\" But the timing is perfect, he added in a statement. \"The good news is the world has only gotten that much stranger, a perfect time to tell these six stories,\" he said.

In their first ever meeting, goals from Javad Nekounam and Vahid Amiri finished off Chile in the international friendly for a remarkable result. Iranian players celebrate Javad Nekounam's (No 6) goal during the friendly match in St Polten, Austria . Alexis Sanchez, who has already played 3,326 minutes  for the Gunners this season, started on the Chile bench alongside Juventus star Arturo Vidal with Sunday's clash against South American counterparts Brazil in mind. A stuttering Chile failed to utilise their dominance in the opening exchanges and were undone by a simple set piece.

It is believed the 6in long enamel and diamond decoration that fixed onto the bottom end of the naval hero's sword case was tossed into the water by thieves decades before. It was discovered in 1973 purely by chance by a police diver searching for a weapon used in a crime. Admiral Lord Nelson's sword scabbard (pictured) is set to sell at auction for up to £70,000 . The chape was from a scimitar sword presented to Nelson by the Sultan Selim III of the Turkish Empire to commemorate the British victory over the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. It is decorated in diamonds with the star and crescent which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent granted to Nelson in 1799. The locket no longer exists as it was melted down years ago but the chape is now coming up for auction in London with a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 to £70,000. The one-armed naval hero (illustrated) was famed for his victories at sea, mostly notably the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar . Michael Moorcroft, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The chape would have been a super-expensive item of the day. 'We can associate it with Nelson through the star and crescent at the centre of the decoration which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent conferred on Nelson in 1799 and as seen in a portrait of him in 1801. 'The sheer quality of workmanship that has gone into it is quite stunning. 'It is an object that is pretty fabulous.' Five years before its discovery, an ornate locket with an identical decoration that was used on the top part of Nelson's scabbard was found during dredging work of the River Wey in Surrey. The location wasn't far from the Thames at Windsor where the chape was found, nor from Nelson's palatial home at Merton. Both discoveries were featured on BBC's Blue Peter. Mr Moorcroft added: 'Both the locket and the chape were found at the bottom of rivers just five years and a few miles apart. The locket was found about 20 miles from Nelson's estate at Merton.

Updated guidance published yesterday insists that calls last for at least 30 minutes if they are offering personal care such as washing or dressing. The advice, published by NHS spending watchdog NICE, said 15-minute drop-ins should only be considered in certain cases such as checking if someone has taken their medication. Better care: Health watchdog NICE has published new guidelines in bid to stop 'drive-by' visits of carers (stock photo) In a sign of how bad things have become, guidelines have to spell out the care offered to the elderly – telling home helps to leave enough time to ‘talk to the person’. Care workers are also reminded to treat people with ‘empathy, courtesy, respect and in a dignified way’. The move marks a victory for the Daily Mail, which has highlighted care visits lasting as little as five minutes as part of our Dignity for the Elderly campaign. Last month a Mail investigation revealed that 70 per cent of councils are still allocating visits of just 15 minutes – with six authorities offering 200,000 slots of just five minutes. Some staff were even told not to chat because it wastes time, while visitors are sometimes poorly trained contractors or ill-suited to the job. In crisis: The recommendations come as Local Government Association say funding for social care is 'in crisis' (stock image) The guidance called on councils to ensure home care workers ‘have time to do their job without being rushed or compromising the dignity of the person who uses services’. It also attempts to stamp out the conveyor belt culture under which pensioners can be seen by ten or 15 different carers in a fortnight, saying ‘continuity of care’ must be a priority. Last night care minister Norman Lamb called on councils to adopt the guidance as soon as possible, saying that many authorities were ‘complicit’ in providing poor care. However, the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said money was just too short to end 15-minute care visits once and for all. Chairman David Sparks said funding for adult social care is ‘in crisis’. GPs are being urged to visit the elderly at least once a year to check they are not too cold, NICE guidance says.

The Juventus striker uploaded an Instagram post to his account on Tuesday posing in his own customised snapback hat. In what appears to be a new range of the 31-year-old, the Argentine's hat is emblazoned with 'TVZ 32' across the front - in an abbreviation of his surname and the number of his jerseys worn at West Ham, Manchester United and their 'noisy neighbours' City.

While the hat may not be easy on the eye to some, the same couldn't be said for Tevez's free-kick in their 1-1 draw at Roma on Monday night. The forward's beautifully-curled effort gave Juve the lead at their Serie A titles rivals in the second half. Speaking after the match, Tevez admitted he had learned how to become a dead-ball specialist from club team-mate Andrea Pirlo. 'I copied [Andrea] Pirlo,' he told the Gazetta dello Sport.

Filmmakers already on location in Rome and the southern city of Matera reportedly made a request to use the ancient stadium immortalised by the film in December. But it was feared the decision to bring hundreds of extras and heavy vehicles into a fragile archaeological site would lead to public outcry. The Circus Maximus (pictured) is an ancient site in Rome once used for the empire's deadly chariot races. Here it is pictured when it hosted the Live 8 concert in 2005 . The Circus Maximus was capable of holding hundreds of thousands of spectators during the chariot races . However, archaeologists said filming at the ancient site would cause 'irreparable damage' to the famous site . The rent of the ancient ground as a set for two weeks would have netted one million euros for the city’s cash-strapped coffers, Corriere della Sera reported. The classic chariot race scene - in which Ben Hur played by Charlton Heston competes against his nemesis Massala - will now be filmed in a purpose-built reproduction arena in Rome’s Cinecittà studios. The Circus Maximus was the centre of a row last summer when the Rolling Stones were allowed to use it for a concert. Heritage experts said the decision to allow 65,000 music fans to rampage over the area would cause irreparable damage to a ‘very fragile’ site. The millionaire rock band were charged just €8,000.

The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\" Gomis told the website. \"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. \"I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.\" Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: \"We can't not be worried, it scares you each time.\" Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. \"He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems,\" Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. \"It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. \"It's no problems whatsoever. It's not as serious as it looks.\" Gomis has scored two league goals for Swansea this season, mostly in a backup role. He became the Welsh side's top striker when Wilfried Bony signed with Manchester City in January.

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke would like to see the number of home-grown players in top-flight squads increased from eight to 12, a move he feels will benefit the national team. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claims clubs were told by Dyke at a meeting on Thursday that the FA could not impose the change. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has spoken out against a quota-based system for home grown players . And Wenger believes those changes will not benefit the league or the national team. In an interview with beIN Sports, Wenger said: 'I believe that we are in the world of competition. Competition means who of you or me is the best one. We have to accept that. 'That means as well that the rules of the game must be structured to favour the best. Or we are not in a competition anymore. The Arsenal boss, on the bench at Newcastle before the international break, is against Greg Dyke's proposals . 'So we can say one of two things - we protect the mediocre or we produce the best players.' Wenger warned that similar schemes in other countries had led to young players becoming 'professional subs', not enhancing their development but downgrading the league standard. 'I give you two examples, he said. 'In Yugoslavia in the past they decided you had to play three players on the team sheet who were under 21. What happened? They became professional subs. It happened in France, too. FA chairman Greg Dyke would like to see at least 12 home-grown players in top-flight squads . 'Then they decided you had to play three players (aged) under 21 from the start. You know what happened? They subbed all three after five minutes.' Dyke's proposal to toughen up home-grown player rules has the backing of UEFA president Michel Platini, who hinted that he intends to follow suit. Should UEFA implement the regulations, then the Premier League would likely have to back down. Dyke hopes a quota-based system for home-grown players would help England manager Roy Hodgson (left)", "completion": "response:\n\nFA chairman Greg Dyke wants 12 home-grown players in top-flight squads .\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger is against such a proposal .\nWenger doesn't think it will help the Premier League or national side ."}

The children, aged seven and two, were quick to alert neighbours by sounding the car horn once they realised their mother was unresponsive. Two children sounded a car horn after finding their mothers body in a parked Holden Captiva . A man hunt for the woman’s partner led to the arrest of a Hackam West local who police say was known to the victim. The man was refused bail and will appear in the Cristies Beach Magistrates Court later today.

The designer of the Swirl tap claims the hollow vortex of water created by the faucet can save around 15 per cent more water than standard taps. He claims that it is also more comfortable to use as the water does not pour out in a solid jet. The Swirl tap sends water from the tap in a symmetrical design that apparently saves 15 per cent more water . Simin Qiu, a student at the London Royal College of Art, said he hoped the design might become popular in hotels and homes. He said: 'It's a very simple design. I've used two turbines to create the effect, with one making the water flow clockwise and the other anticlockwise. 'The spiral is an organic shape water takes in nature and I wanted to recreate that. 'It is more comfortable on people's hands because it's not flowing in a solid line. My design changes the angle the water hits your hands at and it's smoother.' Mr Qiu is curerntly testing a prototype of his tap, which took him two months to design. It uses turbines that spin in opposite directions inside the valve at the mouth of the tap to send thin streams of water spiralling down into the sink. The Swirl tap uses two turbines inside the faucet (left) to send the water into a spiral. The graphic on the right shows how the turbines fit together with push value to provide a spinning vortex of water onto the users hands . The tap works by pressing a single button on top, allowing water at a preset temperature to flow out of the tap . The tap is operated by touching a switch on the top. Mr Qiu says the desing allows water to come out at the same pressure as a standard faucet but uses less water. However, the temperature from the tap has to be preset so that the water coming out will always be the right temperature. Mr Qui added: 'I hope it will be ready by the end of the year. 'It will be more expensive than ordinary taps, it's not something that will be in every home. 'It's a luxury product that will probably be in hotels and limited use in homes by next year.' Designer Simin Qiu envisages his tap being used in hotels and luxury homes but it could find wider uses as the swirling pattern it produces in the flow can help to reduce the amount of water used when washing hands .", "completion": "response:\n\nSwirl tap was designed by art student Simin Qiu at the Royal College of Art .\nHe is currently testing a prototype tap and hopes it will go on sale next year .\nTwo spinning turbines in the tap head send the water into a hollow vortex .\nThis uses 15 per cent less water than traditional taps, the designer claims .\nThe hollow jet is also more gentle to use on the hands than traditional taps ."}

Ebony Walton, 35, had been all set to get hitched to her boyfriend of 18 years when she was turned down for a marriage licence - because of a marriage that she had no clue about. But as she tried to uncover the mystery behind her phantom marriage she realized that her identity was likely stolen by one of her family members who used it to carry out a sham green card marriage. Marriage: Ebony Walton had been all set to get hitched to her boyfriend of 18 years when she was turned down for a marriage licence - because of a marriage to a Pakistani man that she had no clue about . Walton was stunned when officials said they had a record of her marrying a Pakistani immigrant from Gujranwala on December 10, 1997 when she was just 18-years-old. When she thought about the date of the marriage she realized that at that time she had been living with her boyfriend, mother and other family members in a Harlem apartment. Two of her cousins suffered from drug problems and regularly stayed at the apartment and she believed that they stole her identity to get the money, according to The New York Post. In an appeal to a city judge, Walton argued that her cousins had stolen her ID in order to use it, and get paid, for a sham green-card marriage.

Varifocal lenses are worn by those who need help both with long distances, for example when driving, and reading, due to eye deteroriation which generally occurs with age. The lenses usually come with a premium price – with opticians charging up to £398 for just one pair. However, Asda is challenging the High Street by offering varifocal lenses for the same price as single prescription versions, starting at just £40. The chain will also sell a designer frame option at £70, with two pairs for £99, and a premium range for £100, with two pairs for £159. Asda found that designer frames with varifocal lenses cost up to £398 at Optical Express, £240 at Boots, £211 at Vision Express with UV protection, £188 at Specsavers and £175 at Tesco Opticians. Asda calculated the figure of £144 million by working out the difference in price between its varifocal lenses and competitiors’, judged against the fact that three million pensioners bought varifocal lenses in the last 12 months, according to the Mintel Optical Goods Retailing report.

A lifesaving vaccine against meningitis B could be given to babies for just £20 a dose – but it has yet to be introduced because the NHS has failed to agree a price after nine months of negotiations. Bexsero, the first jab to protect against the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis, was recommended for all infants as part of a national immunisation programme in March 2014. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said approval was subject to a cost-effective price being agreed between the manufacturer and the Department of Health, with talks beginning in July 2014. The maximum price being considered under negotiations is around £20 – a significant saving compared with GlaxoSmithKline's 'list price' of £75. Children need three doses in the first year of life, making the maximum final bill for the 700,000 born each year in England and Wales £42million. GPs are also paid a £7.50 fee for each dose administered. Campaigners have warned the lack of urgency from health officials is costing lives. Meningitis B can kill a healthy child within hours of the first symptoms. Since the vaccine was licensed two years ago there have been 1,130 cases, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities. Chris Head, chief executive of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: 'These price negotiations have been ongoing since July 2014. 'Meanwhile babies and children continue to die or suffer devastating injury, with lifelong costs to the government of someone seriously disabled from the disease ranging from £3million to £4.5million.' Earlier this week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible but his hands will be tied by General Election 'purdah' after the middle of next week. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease – but only at a price that represents good value for money for the NHS.'

Now Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg is giving relationship advice so couples can also triumph in the bedroom. In an ongoing series for the New York Times called Women at Work, the social media executive, 45, has suggested engaging in 'choreplay' leads to more sex. Facebook's Chief Operating Officer and mother-of-two Sheryl Sandberg (left and right) believes sharing chores, or 'choreplay', leads to more sex . This doesn't include romantic evenings out or luxury holidays - but simply sharing the duties around the house. The basis of the argument is from a 2009 study by Constance T. Gager and Scott T. Yabiku, which measured The Relationship Between Household Labor Time and Sexual Frequency. Using the results, Sandberg and co-writer Adam Grany suggest: 'Men and women who work hard [together] play hard.' Sandberg suggested that if if a man wanted to do something nice - instead of buying flowers they should do the laundry. The piece continues by saying: 'A man who heard this was asked by his wife one night to do a load of laundry. He picked up the basket and asked hopefully, 'Is this Lean In (reffering to her latest book) laundry?' Choreplay is real.' Citing research from 2000, the pair add 'that when men do their share of chores, their partners are happier and less depressed, conflicts are fewer, and divorce rates are lower.' They also suggest children who spend more time being cared for by their fathers are happier, healthier and less likely to have behavioral problems. For men, being in the company of their young ones make them more patient, emphatic and less likely to drink or do drugs. In 2012 mother-of-two Sandberg was made Facebook's first female board member.

Detective Constable David Holmes, from Kent Police, said: ‘The events of that day will linger long in the memory of those affected, some of whom will never fully recover from their injuries. ‘Juraj Orsula claims he was blinded by the sun in the moments leading up to the collision, which should have been reason enough to reduce his speed. ‘Instead he continued to drive as normal before crashing into stationary traffic and leaving a trail of devastation. He must now live with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.’ Mr Holmes added: 'Hopefully Orsula's sentencing will mark the start of the healing process for everyone affected by this devastating incident, and our thoughts are with them all today.'", "completion": "response:\n\nJuraj Orsula claimed he was blinded by sun when he crashed on M26 .\nHit back of queuing traffic which had built up after two earlier collisions .\nHelen Akande, 22, and her sister Mary, 16, both died at scene of crash .\nTheir father Michael died two weeks later in hospital as result of injuries .\nThree people in another vehicle suffered injuries, including young boys ."}

Motorcyclist Mathew Sant was travelling along Canberra Avenue toward the city on Tuesday in an 80km/h zone when he was rear-ended. Instead of reacting furiously though, he gave the guilty driver a thumbs up. 'Traffic had backed up ahead and come to a stop,' he said on YouTube after uploading a video of what happened. All things seem to be going well as motorcyclist Mathew Sant stops in traffic along Canberra Avenue . Suddenly he is thrown in the air off his motorbike after getting rear-ended by a car . Instead of losing his temper at what happened Mr Sant gives the driver a thumbs up . To make it even clearer there are no hard feelings he shakes the driver's hand . 'As I came to a stop I checked my mirror and moved to the right of the road in case the car behind wasn't paying attention. 'I saw him come to a stop and relaxed, looking away. The next thing I knew I was looking at the sky.' In the YouTube video Mr Sant is seen going steadily along, minding his own business, in a lane of traffic and all seems to be going well.

It's only when he looks back that he sees the rest of the carnage that has taken place . Mr Sant would have been within his rights to give the driver what for, but flashes him a thumbs up instead. It's the last thing the driver expects and he asks worriedly: 'Are you all right mate?' Even then Mr Sant remains cool and composed. He shakes hands with the driver and laughs at all that just happened. It is only then that the motorcyclist walks back to see the carnage that occurred behind him. Mr Sant has then a chance to see how lucky he was after the accident . After breathing a sigh of relief he thanks his lucky stars the accident didn't turn out to be worse . He soon realises that he wasn't the only victim as the initial crash caused a three-car pile up, with other motors badly damaged.

Corden's debut as the fourth host of CBS' \"Late Late Show\" on Monday night was one of the smoothest first episodes of any new talk show hosts in recent memory. Ignoring the usual five minutes or so of monologue jokes, Corden launched right into a star-studded pre-taped bit that showed how he got the job of host: by picking up one of CBS president Les Moonves' Willy Wonka-esque golden ticket dropped by Chelsea Handler (a joke referencing rumors that she was in talks for the job Corden won). Corden received advice from Jay Leno, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Meryl Streep as he trained to be the best host he could be. In a nod to one of his influences, Graham Norton, Corden brought out his two guests, Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks simultaneously.

That pledge is now under serious threat. Protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state as they marched to protest national elections held to elect Nigeria's next President. \"There's been so much violence in Rivers state that it's just not tenable,\" said Lai Mohammed, spokesman for the main opposition party, the All Peoples Congress. The All Peoples Congress says the vote has been rigged, voters intimidated and demanded that the elections held in Rivers state be canceled. The ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party, refutes the accusation, saying the election was \"credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan.\" Heavy rain eventually forced the protesters home, but there are fears that it will take more than rain to stop further protests and violence. \"We are concerned by what seems to be happening,\" said Attahiru Jega, Nigeria's election chairman, about events in Rivers state. Nigeria has just held what are thought to be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule. The two main candidates are incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan and retired general Muhammedu Buhari. What is at stake in the protests in Rivers state is not whether Nigeria can hold an election, but can it hold a \"close\" election. Voting is now over and the results are being counted. Jega says the final result will likely be announced within 48 hours. The fear is that the results may not be accepted by whomever loses. And if the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party, then the protests in Rivers state could spread to northern Nigeria. Over 800 people were killed in post-election violence across the north after the 2011 elections were thought to be illegitimate. And so both candidates have taken to social media to call for calm. \"I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results,\" stated Jonathan on his Facebook account. \"Fellow Nigerians, I urge you to exercise patience and vigilance as we wait for all results to be announced,\" said Buhari on Twitter.", "completion": "response:\n\nIncumbent President Goodluck Jonathan and retired general Muhammedu Buhari faced off in election .\nIt could be the closest elections since a return to democracy in 1999 after decades of military rule .\nThere are fears that results may not be accepted by the losers ."}

The suspects are being questioned over a range of offenses, including arson, rioting, attempted murder and murder, said L.L. Doungal, the police chief of Nagaland, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. They're alleged to be among a crowd of thousands of people who stormed a jail in the Dimapur district, and dragged out the suspected rapist before beating him to death in the street. The 35-year-old victim had been accused of raping a local woman last month. \"There were thousands of them. Many of them were students in uniform,\" Doungal said when news of the attack first emerged. The dead man was initially identified as an undocumented Bangladeshi settler, but now police say they still are determining his nationality. \"I am not ruling out that he's not a Bangladeshi. I am also not denying that he is not an Indian. We are verifying his nationality,\" said G. Akheto Sema, an additional director-general of Nagaland's police, when asked about local reports suggesting the attacked man was an Indian citizen. Dimapur town remains under a curfew, Sema said, amid growing tensions between native Nagas and Bangladeshi migrants in the district. Thousands of protesters demanding the cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said.

Later, police opened fire, but it was too late to save the suspect. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack, according to authorities. \"We retrieved his body before it could be hung,\" Doungal said.

Abdelrahman has a network of activists on the ground in Syria. On Saturday, the observatory -- citing an Assyrian commander -- said that ISIS planned to release 29 Assyrian Christian hostages. ISIS captured at least 220 Assyrians, all Christians, on February 23 during an attack on the villages around the town of Tal Tamer in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory said Saturday that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release, citing an Assyrian commander. The \"court\" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. The Syrian Observatory said its information indicates ISIS has taken the hostages to the Mount Abdelaziz area, southwest of Tal Tamer. The founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network, Osama Edward, puts the number of Assyrian hostages at more than 262. Edward is based in Sweden but has family in the area that was attacked, and says his information is from the network's team on the ground. The number of hostages has climbed steadily, from an initial estimate of between 70 and 100 people seized on Monday to 150 as of Wednesday, with women, children and the elderly among them. The number of people executed by the terrorist group has also climbed steadily. Since the declaration of its \"caliphate\" last June, ISIS has killed 1,969 people, the Syrian Observatory said Saturday. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for \"exceeding the limits in religion,\" the Syrian Observatory said. \"We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing\" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September.

Starting with a 2-1 defeat to Scotland, the magnificent granite sculpture charts more than a century of England's footballing failures, finishing with a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Romania in the 1998 World Cup. The gloomy untitled piece was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan and was being auctioned by Sotherby's as part of their Bear Witness art sale, which has already generated £26.5 million. The granite sculpture details all of England's losses between 1874 and 1998 . The piece, created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, has fetched an incredible £425,000 at Sotherby's .

Mr Cattelan said: 'Carved into it are all the defeats of England's national football team. I guess it's a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death.' Among the defeats etched into the enormous black structure is the infamous 2-1 loss to Argentina in 1986, immortalised by Diego Maradona's 'Hand of God' goal, and the shock 1-0 to the USA in 1950. It was first exhibited in 1999 and its sale comes in the wake of one of England's worst performance at an international tournament in recent memory, after they crashed out of the 2014 World Cup without a single win. Mr Cattelan is known for his satirical art pieces and is the mastermind behind other works such as a sculpture depicting Pope John Paul II being hit by a meteorite.

For they burn far fewer calories watching TV on the sofa than their partners do. Doctors who measured how much energy three couples expended during day-to-day activities found large differences between the amounts men and women used. No time to relax: Women burn far fewer calories watching TV on the sofa than their partners do . All six ate a 600-calorie fry-up before each couple was assigned a different activity: an hour in the gym, three hours of cleaning, or lounging about. Their energy use was then assessed. Patrick and Roma Burn were lucky enough to spend the morning on the sofa. But while Patrick burned up 640 calories just by being a couch potato, Roma used only 292. The results are to be shown in a BBC1 programme, The Truth About Calories. Presenter Dr Chris van Tulleken said women tended to burn fewer calories at rest than men because they did not weigh as much and had less energy-hungry muscle mass. ‘Bigger people burn more calories than smaller ones,’ he said. But Patrick and Roma were extreme examples, he noted, as Mr Burn was ‘100kg of lean muscle’ and his wife ‘probably weighed half that’. A morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout, the programme found . The programme also found a morning of light housework consumed just as many calories as one involving a strenuous workout, which left the couple exhausted. Jim Norris got through 834 calories and his wife Elaine 729 during the morning, in which they spent an hour in the gym lifting weights. Meanwhile, Nick and Margaret Shenkin burnt 862 and 629 calories respectively cleaning the house.

She added Southern Water had taken more than two weeks to fix a different drain in the same road - and then told her it was the county council who were responsible for the repair. The council then passed it back to Southern Water, who passed it back to the council. The faulty cover has been causing havoc for nearby residents, since it came loose in November last year . Another resident David Davis described the noise as 'piercing', adding it was a 'low level annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless'. The father-of-two added: 'This is driving us crazy.

Councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high-tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old, low-tech versions, according to the People's Daily Online. The seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red-faced, turning for sale in various places around the world. High tech: The new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves . Problem: More than 240,000 manholes were stolen in Beijing over a 10 year period, thanks to metal values . The chains also proved unpopular, with many pointing out they could easily be cut, and were dangerous for people walking along the street. One man has even demanded compensation after falling flat on his face, thanks to the chain. It is hoped these new covers, which were developed by a Chinese tech company, will not only put would-be thieves off stealing the items, but also help track those who do give into temptation. The covers, along with drain grills, can fetch high prices on the black market, as the price of scrap metal has spiraled in recent years. It has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from Beijing's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone. Measures: Previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked . The new covers, designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features, are made out of a metal with a far lower value, as a further deterrent. A test batch of 100 smart manhole covers will be placed on streets in the city of Hangzhou this month,  and - if it is a success - they will be added throughout the city. But it is not just about the money. Officials have revealed there is a safety concern motivating their purchases as well, as people could trip on an upturned manhole. Tao Xiaomin, of Hangzhou urban management office, explained: 'When a cover is moved and the tilt angle is greater than 15 degrees, the tag will send an alarm signal to us.'", "completion": "response:\n\nNew high-tech covers hope to curb the number of thefts on China's streets .\nMore than 240,000 manhole covers stolen in Beijing over a 10-year period .\nAuthorities previously tried chaining them to lamp posts to prevent thefts .\nBut people derided the idea as 'stupid' because thieves just cut the chains ."}

The tiny Ili Pika, an eight-inch long rabbit-relative, is one of the world's most endangered animals with less than 1,000 animals believed to be left in its natural habitat. The Ili Pika population is believed to have declined by almost 70 per cent since its discovery in 1983, scientists say. Adorable: The Ili Pika is one of the world's rarest mammals, and has been spotted for the first time in 20 years in its natural territory in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China . The Ili Pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, was discovered by conservationist Li Weidong in 1983, who named it after his hometown. The animals can only be found in the Tianshan mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, and its territory is under threat, with the population rapidly declining. When the Ili Pika was first discovered, Mr Li and his team estimated that there were around 2,900 animals living in the Tianshan mountain range. Nearly 20 years later, in 2002, Mr Li conducted a new demographic, which found that the population had dropped to 2,000. Last year's fresh census, which is when the Ili Pika was spotted for the first time in 20 years, concluded that the population is down to less than 1,000 pikas.

'If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty.' Very little is known about this rare species, as no successful observations about its ecology, behaviour or reproduction has been carried out. Mr Li believes global warming is the cause of the decline in Ili Pikas as the altitude of permanent snow in the Tianshan mountain range has risen. 'This tiny species could be extinct any time,' Mr Li added. 'They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore.'

But in China, they place equal emphasis on those applying to work on their new bullet trains. 1,500 applicants took part in five different professional exams in a bid to become one of the 90 new students for the bullet train attendant training course earlier today. Four applicants give their best pose during the exams at Shandong Jiaotong University . One woman shows off her dancing skills in front of the judges . The mix of women and men went through a number of different tests at the event held by Shandong Jiaotong University in Jinan, Shandong province of China. The guidelines to become one of the attendants are extremely strict and take into account everything from skills to body height. Zulhumar Tursun, 22, who was enrolled on an earlier training programme told China Daily that when she applied in 2014, she was chosen from nearly 5,000 applicants. She said: 'Applicants need to be 166 to 174 centimeters tall and the desired weight ranges from 52 to 58 kilograms.' Balance is a key issue on the bullet trains, which reach extremely high speeds . Some of the women were already dressed in attendant uniforms for the exams . A woman applies her make-up ahead of meeting the judges . The successful applicants are then sent to train in internships on high-speed lines across the country. Drivers of the trains have to undergo even stricter tests that take several aspects of their health into account. Driver Adi Turdi told the paper: 'We had our eyesight, hearing and hearts checked, as well as our psychological condition, because the requirements for bullet train drivers are higher than those for operators of lower-speed trains.

The 56,300-ton warship, which was launched in 1956, was decommissioned in 1993 but kept in storage for possible reactivation until March 2004 when it was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it and turn it into a museum. But attempts by groups in Long Beach, California, and Fairview, Oregon, to do so came up short of meeting U.S. government requirements for donation. The Long Beach group called itself Top Gun Super Carrier in reference to the Ranger's role in the 1986 Tom Cruise movie. The carrier was used for interior shots in the film, which also featured appearances by the carriers USS Carl Vinson and USS Enterprise, according to Internet Movie Database. In December, the Navy paid International Shipbreaking of Brownsville, Texas, a penny to take the carrier off its hands. The shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap. The Ranger, which left Bremerton on Thursday, follows two of its predecessors in the Forrestal class of carriers -- the Forrestal and the Saratoga -- to scrapyards in Brownsville. Another carrier, the USS Constellation, part of the Kitty Hawk class, was towed to Brownsville last year. Like the Ranger, the Constellation was stored in Washington and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of South America, as it would not fit through the Panama Canal.

The Spaniard missed the opening race of the season in Melbourne last week after suffering concussion in an unexplained testing accident in Barcelona. Although Alonso has since posted Twitter messages declaring himself fit and ready, the FIA have appointed three Cambridge doctors to test him.

One will be carried out by the FIA’s medical delegate, Jean-Charles Piette, who will require Alonso to do a 45-minute computer test to assess his reaction times. His score will be compared with his previous results on the same test. The local doctor at the Sepang International Circuit will also examine Alonso. Alonso missed the Australian Grand Prix after a crash in pre-season testing in Barcelona .

Lerner has entered into discussion with a consortium over a proposed £150million sale of the Midlands club. And Sportsmail understands Lerner is expected to fly into Birmingham over the coming days for further discussions regarding a sale. Randy Lerner, pictured in 2011, is speaking to a consortium over a proposed £150million sale of Aston Villa . Talks over a takeover are understood to be at an advanced stage and Lerner’s decision to fly into England is viewed as a key step towards the completion of a deal. The consortium is in the due diligence stage of their proposed takeover, though the eventual price of the sale will depend on which league Villa are playing in next season. Christian Benteke is pictured scoring for Aston Villa in their 4-0 thumping of Sunderland last month . Lerner wants to receive his full £150m asking price . Lerner’s expected arrival in the Midlands comes after it emerged Lerner’s Midlands property has been made available as part of the takeover. The farmhouse, located in Bodymoor Heath, is understood to be worth in the region of £3m. Lerner has been keen to sell Villa for some time, a period that has seen the club go through a difficult period on the pitch. The sacking of Paul Lambert and subsequent arrival of Tim Sherwood has helped stimulate the club, as has their pending FA Cup semi-final. But Villa are still in danger of dropping into the second tier of English football for the first time since 1987. Lerner is desperate for the team to avoid that scenario as he looks to receive his full £150m asking price. Relegation into the Championship would severely lower Villa’s value, possibly as much as half.

The Northern Ireland international left Ibrox fans incensed in the summer of 2012 when he walked out post-liquidation to join Swiss side Sion on a free transfer. But, as he prepares to play in Glasgow for the first time in almost three years in Wednesday night’s international friendly at Hampden, the 27-year-old revealed he has unfinished business at Rangers. Kyle Lafferty said he is disappointed with how his time at Rangers ended in the summer of 2012 . Lafferty admitted that he would like to return to Rangers to improve fans perceptions of him . Lafferty is set to play in Glasgow for the first time since his exit for Northern Ireland on Wednesday . ‘Some Rangers fans have asked me if I’d go back there - and I’d jump at the chance,’ admitted Lafferty, who is under contract at Norwich until the summer of 2017 but currently on loan at Turkish side Rizespor. ‘But whether that’s an option or not is another thing.’ Lafferty won three SPL titles and both League and Scottish Cups during his controversial spell at the Govan club between 2008 and 2012. However, he saw his attitude and commitment regularly questioned amid a series of on and off-field mishaps, including high-profile bust-ups with both Neil Lennon and Ally McCoist. Lafferty was one of a number of leading players – including Steven Naismith and captain Steve Davis – who were branded mercenaries by then-chief executive Charles Green after exercising their right to refuse to transfer their registrations over to newco Rangers. Lafferty is part of the Northern Ireland side who will face Scotland in a friendly on Wednesday at Hampden . Lafferty hopes that he will one day have an opportunity to return to Glasgow to play club football . ‘What happened for me at Rangers was disappointing,’ he continued. ‘The way it happened (leaving on a free after liquidation) wasn’t how I wanted to end my career there - but it had to be done. ‘But I’ve supported Rangers since I was a young boy and I still support them now.

A study found that the more satisfied a person was with their love life in their 60s and 70s, the sharper their mind and the better their memory. One possibility is that an active sex life keeps the brain young. The finding follows a recent British study which revealed that age is no barrier to an active love life. Dutch researchers found that people in their 70s having sex were better able to use their memory, file photo . The Manchester University study found, more than half of men and almost a third of women aged 70-plus are still sexually active. And one third of these have sex at least twice a month. The latest study involved quizzing more than 1,700 Dutch men and women about their sex life and their need for intimacy. The volunteers, who ranged in age from 58 to 98, were also put through a battery of mental tests, designed to assess everything from memory to the ability to think abstractly. Two-thirds of the men and women had a partner and a similar number said that they still felt the need for intimacy. Those who were satisfied with their sex life and said that sexuality was important did better on the tests. The link was particularly strong in women, the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry reports. The researchers, from the Altrecht mental health centre, can’t be sure if staying sexually active was keeping the brain or if interest in sex dwindles as the mind fails. However, previous research has credited having sex with the growth of new brain cells, in rats at least. It has also been suggested that doing a crossword is better for the brain than an orgasm – because it gives the whole brain a workout, rather than just one area of it. Researchers have found that rats can boost their brain power by having more sex than normal . The Dutch researchers said it is important not to assume that sex is just for the young. They wrote: ‘Many beliefs about sexual behaviour in older populations are based on personal and stereotyped views of ageing and sexuality. ‘Older persons are generally expected to no longer be capable of or to be lacking interest in sex when, in reality, many elderly persons require sexuality to be important and wish to remain sexually active as they age. ‘Age itself is no adequate predictor of sexuality; the reality of ageing is that most people continue to have sexual feelings of some sort.’ ends .", "completion": "response:\n\nUniversity researchers found that sex in later life helps boost memory .\nMore than half of men and a third of women over 70 are sexually active .\nOne third of the old people surveyed admitted having sex twice a month .\nDutch researchers quizzed people aged between 58 and 98 .\nThey also subjected them to a battery ."}

'It was a song that worked real well as a wake-up call because of the loud beat in it and it also works real well because of the message of the song,' Holiday Inn Marketing Director Philip Corvin told WJHG. 'For these kids, this would have been one of their first Disney movies. We thought it would be kind of neat to play something from their childhood and see how they react to it.'

The deal with Dallas is heavily incentive-driven and was first revealed by NFL insider Ian Rapoport. The Carolina Panthers put the franchise tag on Hardy in February 2014, guaranteeing him $13.1. He was arrested and charged on May 13 with assaulting and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend Nicole Holder. Hardy was found guilty on July 15 by a Mecklenburg County judge, but on appeal to a jury trial (a quirk of North Carolina law), charges were dropped when Holder refused to co-operate with the prosecutor. In purely football terms, the Cowboys have strengthened a position of need. Last season, the Cowboys defense mustered 28 sacks last season. During his 2013 season, defensive end Hardy made the Pro Bowl and recorded 15 sacks; in 2012 he had 11 and adds an extra dimension to Rod Marinelli's 4-3 scheme.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe 26-year-old defensive end joins on an incentive-laden one-year deal .\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers dropped out of the chase for Hardy, who was released by the Carolina Panthers after he was placed on the exempt list .\nHe was arrested and charged in May last year with assaulting and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend .\nThe case was dismissed in court in February after a lack of co-operation from the accuser ."}

He was convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust . Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has been convicted  of unlawfully accepting money from a U.S. supporter in a retrial of corruption charges. The 69-year-old accepted around £104,000 ($153,950) from Morris Talansky while he was a cabinet minister, Jerusalem District Court heard. He could now be given five years in prison - in addition to a six-year sentence he received in 2014 for a separate bribery conviction. His lawyers said they are likely to appeal the latest ruling. Following the verdict Uri Korev, prosecuting, said: 'His behaviour constitutes a breach of trust which harms the public, harms morality and harms the public's trust in how he behaved corruptly.' Olmert gave former office manager Shula Zaken part of the money in exchange for loyalty as well as using some for personal use without reporting it, the judges concluded. He was convicted of illicitly receiving money, fraud and breach of trust. Eyal Rozovsky, Olmert's lawyer, said their legal team was 'of course very disappointed' by the ruling. Olmert resigned in early 2009 amid corruption allegations. He was originally acquitted in 2012 of a series of charges including accepting cash-stuffed envelopes from Talansky while he was mayor of Jerusalem. He received around £406,000 ($600,000) from the U.S. businessman but there was no evidence the money had been used for unlawful person reasons or illegal campaign financing, the court said. At the time Olmert was convicted on a lesser charge of breach of trust after steering job appointments and contracts to clients of a business partner. Olmert gave former office manager Shula Zaken part of the money in exchange for loyalty as well as using some for personal use, the judges concluded. A retrial was organised after Zaken became a state witness, offering diary entries and tape recordings of conversations with Olmert about illicitly receiving cash. In a separate trial in March 2014 Olmert was convicted of bribery  and was sentenced to six years in prison. He appealed and has been allowed to stay out of jail until a verdict is delivered. The judges must now decide if Olmert should serve additional prison time for today's conviction or whether his six-year sentence is enough  for both offences, legal expert Emanuel Gross said.

They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world. Ella's series, \"First and foremost I am,\" consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21, the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjavík Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography. Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport. The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on \"the beauty and diversity of mankind\" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable. \"I am not against prenatal/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world.\" The title of the series, \"First and foremost I am,\" comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project. \"I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora,\" Jonsdottir writes. \"I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies.\" Jonsdottir goes on to say, \"Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?\" Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects \"to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together.\" The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot. \"My favorite part of this project was how relaxed the atmosphere was. No one was pretending to be anything, the emotions were real and some of the times, there was such genuine happiness.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nSigga Ella's portraits show people with Down syndrome from 9 months to 60 years old .\nShe hopes her photos shine a light on \"the beauty and diversity of mankind\""}

Spieth won a three-way play-off with a 28-foot birdie on the third extra hole to become only the fourth player since 1940 to win twice on the PGA Tour before turning 22. It is a feat that not even McIlroy mastered with Tiger Woods, Sergio Garcia and Robert Gamez the only players to have achieved that particular accolade in the past 75 years. But it is the Northern Irishman that is within Spieth's focus heading towards Augusta. \"I like studying the game, being a historian of the game,\" Spieth told the PGA Tour website. \"It's really cool to have my name go alongside those. \"But right now currently what I'm really focused on is Rory McIlroy and the No.1 in the world.

But going into the four majors of the year, to have closed one out in this kind of fashion is going to give me a lot of confidence.\" Spieth has long been heralded as the next big thing in golf -- shining in the amateur ranks with two U.S. junior titles and leading last year's Masters after the third round before eventually finishing tied for second, three shots behind Bubba Watson. On Sunday, he held his nerve at the Innisbrook Resort in Palm Harbor, Florida, to hold on for the victory. He first rescued par on the 16th with a 60-foot bunker shot and needed a 32-foot putt to ensure his place in the playoff, which he duly holed.

Interspersed with the footage of the prisoners is footage of a dead child under the rubble and in a body bag, and a dead man at the hospital, who appears to have been shot. The makers of the video seem to want to point the finger of blame for their latest horrendous actions at the coalition forces' campaign against ISIS. Revenge: The militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold . To make that clear, the video begins with a mock-up of a coalition airstrike, complete with a fake jet seemingly piloted by someone with an American accent. ‘By God we will get our revenge,’ the video states.

With his team leading La Liga and on the verge of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Manchester City, Pique took time away from training to interact with his fans. When asked who were the best defenders he has played alongside, the 28-year-old listed a pair of stalwarts from the two clubs he has signed for during his career: Carles Puyol at Barcelona and Rio Ferdinand of Manchester United. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique opened up during a Facebook Q&A session with fans . The Spain international scores a rare goal during the 6-1 defeat of Rayo Vallecano on March 8 .

A young Pique listens as Ferdinand gives youngsters advice during their time together at Old Trafford . Pique arrived at Manchester United from Barcelona's La Masia academy as a teenager in 2004 before returning to Barcelona four years later when opportunities at Old Trafford became limited, primarily because of the established form of Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. The Spaniard, who has a child with pop songstress Shakira, bears a similar cultured style to Ferdinand in the mould of a tall defender with excellent technique who is comfortable on the ball.

However, for those seeking perfection - a runny yolk - every time, help might soon be at hand. The New Egg Company, based in Nottingham, has come up with the idea of a pre-cooked egg, which requires little more than five minutes of reheating. The downside? At £1.79 per pack, it'll cost around fives times the price of a standard egg. Eggstraordinary: The Yowk is a pre-cooked egg that promises the ideal yolk every time and even comes with soldiers, salt and a spoon . Marketed as the Yowk - 'simple dippy goodness', the pasteurised egg arrives in a plastic pot having already been cooked in its shell using the 'sous vide' method favoured by many top chefs - essentially the modern equivalent of boiling in the bag. The pot lid doubles up as an egg cup, say the makers and even comes with breadsticks, salt and a spoon to eat it with. The diner simply adds boiling water to the pot and leaves it for five minutes with a perfect, runny yolk guaranteed. This new method may seem no quicker than the traditional way to boil an egg; by immersing it in a pan of water and boiling it for around four minutes. However,  it could extract the potential for arguments over the best way to boil an egg. And the egg overflowth...a runny yolk is many people's idea of egg heaven . Foolproof? The Yowk uses the sous vide method, favoured by top chefs, to produce the perfect yolk . Kitchens can be a hotbed of tension as home cooks dispute the perfect amount of time an egg should boil for, whether eggs should be kept in a fridge or at room temperature; placed in cold water and then boiled; or just in boiling water. New Egg Company managing director Ian Hetherington told trade journal The Grocer that the product was the result of improving on an earlier prototype called 'the Dippy Egg' back in 2013. He said: 'It didn't take off the first time but the concept was still in its infancy. 'We have undertaken a lot more testing to get the product right.' The product is to be unveiled at the International Food Event trade show later this month before aiming to be listed in supermarkets and possibly food and drink outlets in May. A coffee chain has already expressed interest in selling it, along with some retailers, Hetherington told The Grocer.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe Yowk pre-cooked egg simply needs reheating for five minutes to achieve the perfect yolk, say the makers .\nPacks will retail at £1.79 each and come complete with an egg cup, spoon, soldier-style breadsticks and salt .\nThe product looks likely to hit supermarket shelves in May ."}

'And then the police arrived.' But rather than calming the situation down, the appearance of the officers seemed to fuel the conflict and the firemen quickly turned on the police. Matos said: 'It was really bizarre. Flash point: Officers were brought in to ease tensions, but had to defend themselves after being attacked by fire fighters . 'The police were trying to separate the two groups when they came under attack from the firemen who started punching them, and then more policemen who turned up to stop the fighting were also attacked. 'It was like something out of a very bad comedy.' Now furious city officials have demanded an explanation. A spokesman for the council said: 'This was appalling behaviour from those we employ to safeguard the city. 'Instead of behaving like public officials they behaved like children in a playground.

Amos Yee, a moppy-haired teenager posted an online video peppered with expletives that slammed the late leader, who died last week, as a \"horrible person\" and \"undoubtedly totalitarian.\" He also made comments comparing Lee to Jesus Christ and Mao Zedong. Lee, highly revered in Singapore was buried Sunday with thousands gathering in a massive state funeral service. While admired for his role turning the former British colony into a financial power house, Lee was also criticized for tamping down on free speech in Singapore.

Critics say Yee's arrest highlights the restrictions on free speech in Singapore. The Committee to Protect Journalists called for the teen's immediate release. Yee faces three charges: intent to wound the religious feelings of any person; circulating obscene objects; and making threatening and abusive or insulting communications. He could face up to three years in prison. Deputy Commissioner of Police Tan Chye Hee said: \"Police take a stern view of acts that could threaten religious harmony in Singapore. Any person who uploads offensive content online with deliberate intention of wounding the religious or racial feelings of any person will be firmly dealt with in accordance with the law.\" The Strait Times newspaper reported that Yee's bail was set at $14,500 and that Yee's father apologized to Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the son of Lee Kuan Yew.", "completion": "response:\n\nSingapore teenager arrested over comments about late leader in YouTube video .\nCriticisms over jailing teenager and restriction on freedom of speech ."}

The forces have started \"the decisive operation\" to liberate Tikrit just over a week after the overall operation began, advancing toward the city from several directions, according to a statement from the predominantly Shiite paramilitary force Hashd Al-Shaab. ISIS wasn't making it easy, however. The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit, preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces on March 1 to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Tikrit, best known to Westerners as the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, fell in June to ISIS, which has captured parts of Iraq and Syria for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. In the past few days, forces progressed roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) down one road toward the city and, by Monday, were about a mile from its center. ISIS fighters have retreated toward the city center from frontline positions, Hashd Al-Shaab's media office said Tuesday. Al-Shaab's forces appear to be leading the fight for Tikrit, with support from the Iraqi army and Sunni tribesmen. Also assisting is Iran, which has provided advisers, weapons and ammunition to the Iraqi government. According to the Pentagon, there may be Iranians operating heavy artillery and rocket launchers as well. There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city, it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible. The Tikrit offensive involves around 30,000 fighters.

According to court documents, Mohammed Emwazi used 22-year-old Gina Morgan’s wedding in 2011 as cover for a secret meeting with members of his terror network.

Emwazi turned up with another man, Mohammed Mekki, and is then thought to have discussed ‘extremist activity’ with CE. The papers state that Ms Nuth ‘describes as “absurd” the suggestion that extremist activity was discussed’. However they note that ‘Ms Nuth left shortly after the arrival of Mekki and Emwazi at about 10pm and so cannot speak of what occurred after her departure’. Later that year all three men were described in court as supplying funds and equipment to Somalian terrorists. Ms Nuth told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I don’t want to get drawn into all this.

As females fight for equality on all terms, stars like Emma Watson have encountered awkward situations at the end of a meal when they insist on paying their way. But others, like Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton say that a man SHOULD look after a woman - in her new blog for Babycentre, the singer explains why Emma's stance on male chivalry is wrong. Natasha Hamilton with her boyfriend Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive . Natasha, who is currently dating Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive, said: 'What is wrong with a man displaying good old fashioned ‘chivalry’ and feeling uncomfortable that she wants to pay? 'This is not a weakness on either side, it’s about letting a man be a considerate, generous, kind human being. Why emasculate him? It’s unnecessary. 'This just puts more pressure on women.' Natasha goes on to point out that the pay gap between women and women is still huge in most of the western world, so through no fault of their own,females bring home much less money than their male counterparts. She said: 'I recently took part in the TV show The Big Reunion, which was a great success. 'But the following year all the female acts got dropped from the tour and all the male acts had yet another opportunity to bring home the bacon.' Actress Emma Watson recently revealed that she tried to pay for the bill at the end of a date and it made the man feel very awkward . Natasha continued: 'There are so many expectations placed on women now. 'If shows like Ex-On-the-Beach are anything to go by, its common place for lads to think they can “bang” as many “birds” as they want, like we’re pieces of meat. 'This is the cultural shift that is openly part of the youth today. 'On top of this, now it’s being suggested girls “pick up their own tab”. Well, it just gets rosier for men doesn’t it?' Natasha Hamilton (left) with her Atomic Kitten band mates Jenny Frost (centre) and Liz McClarnon (right) in 2003 . In fact, Natasha believes that in the 21st Century, it is crucial that men be taught to look after the fairer sex. She said: 'I personally think that men should look after women.

The Duke’s first ever trip to GCHQ, housed in a doughnut-shaped building in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed that he and other young Royals were being advised to change their email addresses and cut back on social media activities over fears they could be targeted by foreign spies and hackers. But questions were asked last night about the Duke’s use of a publicly funded Royal helicopter to make the trip, as it was not an official public engagement and was not announced in the Palace’s Court Circular.

There were just 22 cases of meningitis W in 2009, but this shot up to 117 last year, according to Public Health England. This is a rise of 431 per cent. Some experts said the levels could even indicate a public health emergency. While the rise was initially seen in adults, it has now extended to all age groups and, for the first time in a decade, young children have died as a result of MenW. There has also been a rise in cases among students. It is proposed to immunise teenagers aged 14 to 18 in an attempt to halt the disease’s spread. Andrew Pollard, chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said the upsurge in cases was caused by a ‘highly aggressive strain of the bug’. He said: ‘We reviewed the outbreak in detail and concluded that this increase was likely to continue in future years unless action is taken. ‘We have therefore advised the Department of Health to implement a vaccination programme for teenagers as soon as possible which we believe will have a substantial impact on the disease and protect the public’s health.’ Campaigners said the Government’s delay in introducing a vaccine against meningitis B – the last major strain of the disease – may have hindered the fight. Statistics show one baby dies every month in Britain from meningitis B and charities claim dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials. Chris Head, of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: ‘We applaud the quick action by the Government to protect 14 to 18-year-olds using the MenACWY vaccine. ‘However, it will take more than a year for this protection to filter through to toddlers and infants, and in the meantime under-fives will still be dying and disabled as a result of MenW.’", "completion": "response:\n\nThere were 117 cases of meningitis W in 2014 compared to 22 in 2009 .\nSome experts claim the rise could indicate a public health emergency .\nFor the first time some young children have died as a result of MenW ."}

Treatment: An American who contracted Ebola was expected to arrive Friday at the NIH research hospital in Bethesda after being transported to the United States in isolation on a chartered plane (file photo) The patient is the 10th person with Ebola to be treated in the U.S. and the second admitted to the NIH Clinical Center, which has one of the few containment facilities nationwide set up to treat Ebola patients. The patient had been volunteering at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone, but the NIH did not release any further details about the patient. Previously, an American nurse was treated there after she contracted Ebola while caring for a Liberian man, Thomas Duncan, who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. The nurse, Nina Pham, survived and is Ebola-free. 'The NIH Clinical Center also admitted two individuals who experienced high-risk exposures to the Ebola virus while working on the Ebola response in West Africa, but who were ultimately found not to be infected,' the agency said in its statement.

The center's Special Clinical Studies Unit is staffed by specialists in infectious disease and critical care and is designed to prevent the spread of highly contagious viruses, including Ebola. The World Health Organization estimated Thursday that the virus has killed more than 10,000 people, mostly in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The current outbreak is the largest ever for the disease, however, as deaths have slowed dramatically in recent months, the virus appears stubbornly entrenched in parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone.", "completion": "response:\n\nPatient  arrived Friday morning at NIH research hospital in Bethesda .\nPatient's condition was still being evaluated after being flown in isolation .\nNIH did not release any further details about the patient .\nNurse Nina Pham was previously treated for Ebola at the hospital, survived and is now free of the virus ."}

But this motorcyclist cut it a little too close as his bike crept out onto a main road, straight into the path of a speeding lorry. The terrifying footage, captured by a dashboard camera in Khabarovsk, Russia, shows the moment the man's bike is swept away under the wheels of the lorry – but the rider miraculously escapes with his life. The moped rider looks tentative from the start of the clip as he eventually makes his way to the front of the queue of cars . Captured at the start of the clip, the man on the moped appears to attempt braking as he reaches the junction but seems to lose control and move forward further than expected. The car, recording the footage from behind the bike, shows the moment it jumps forward, straight into the path of the oncoming lorry. Hitting the lorry’s back wheels, the bike is pulled away from underneath its rider as his head is thrown back violently by the impact. Suddenly the moped rider appears to lose control and speeds up, crashing into the side of the moving lorry . The moped’s top box is also hurled down the road by the lorry and more worryingly so is the man’s helmet, which becomes detached during the crash.

More than 19,000 people have signed up to participate in a game at an Amsterdam IKEA store and another 32,000 at a shop in Eindhoven, forcing management to ban the event citing safety concerns. The bizarrely popular events were inspired by the success of a game held in a Belgium store last year in which 500 adults participated and were discovered hiding in fridges, cupboards and underneath piles of soft toys. More than 32,000 people were planning to play a game of hide and seek at an IKEA store in Eindhoven next month, forcing management to ban the game. File image used .

The 16-year-old surfer told police he had fallen off his board and upon resurfacing, felt something in the water that felt like hair. Upon tugging up the object out of the water, he said he realised it was a man's body . 'He then grabbed at the item and when he pulled up the item he saw the face of someone at which point he panicked, let go of the body and returned to shore. 'He later returned to the water with a friend to try and find the body but they couldn't locate it and contacted police around 8.30 this morning.' Gold Coast Water Police Senior Sergeant Gavin Peachey told the Brisbane Times: 'That's what he [the surfer] believes - there's nothing to confirm that at the moment.' Police immediately launched a search of the area using boats, jet skis and a helicopter; however they have received no reports of a missing person in the area. Abandoned items of clothing were found on the beach, including a Maktec by Makita hat and a white Volcan t-shirt, however they have since been claimed by a member of the public and have been deemed unrelated to the incident. Police responded by launching an land, air and sea search at Palm Beach (pictured) at the Gold Coast in Queensland on Friday, where investigations are still continuing . While the land and air search is continuing into Friday night, the water search has now been suspended. 'Police will reassess tomorrow morning if they will continue the search, they'll probably wait to see if they get reports of anyone missing. So far there are no reports to suggest someone is missing,' the spokesperson said. A statement from Queensland police urged 'anyone who may know of any person who may not have returned home from a morning swim in the Palm Beach area to please make contact with police'. The body was described as being a man in his 20's with dark hair.

Levinson, a retired FBI agent, vanished after traveling to the Iranian island of Kish in March 2007 and is one of the longest-held U.S. citizens in history. The FBI announced the reward increase on the eighth anniversary of Levinson's disappearance -- and the day before his 67th birthday. \"Levinson traveled to Kish Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007, working on behalf of several large corporations, and his whereabouts, well-being and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance have been unknown since that time,\" it said in a statement.

Year after year, the family has endured the pain of his absence. It is time for him to come home,\" Kerry said. \"We remain committed to the safe return of Mr. Levinson to his family and appreciate the support and assistance from our international partners. We remain concerned about Mr. Levinson's health given his age and the length of his disappearance.\" Iran's government repeatedly has said it is not holding Levinson and does not know his whereabouts. The FBI says he was in Iran as a private investigator. But news reports in 2013 said he was working as an independent CIA contractor when he disappeared. That prompted his family to speak out, saying they kept it quiet for years that Levinson was working for the CIA, because the U.S. government had warned them that revealing it would put him in more jeopardy. The FBI, White House and CIA have not publicly acknowledged any connection between the CIA and Levinson. It's unclear exactly who is holding him, but U.S. officials have said they believe he is somewhere in southwest Asia. Whoever his captors are, in 2010 they sent a \"proof of life\" videotape and photographs of Levinson to his family. In the video, he asked the U.S. government for help: \"Please help me get home,\" a gaunt-looking Levinson said on the tape, citing his 33 years of service in the FBI as a reason for that help.

Egypt is ready to ditch Cairo and build a shiny new capital  if the government has its way. Fed up with pollution, traffic gridlock, a packed population with soaring rents and creaking infrastructure, Egypt is teaming up with a developer in the United Arab Emirates to build a city in what could be one of the world's most ambitious infrastructure programs. The yet-to-be-named city will spread out over 150 square miles, or roughly the size of Denver, and could eventually be home to 7 million people, the developers and government announced Friday. The current capital of Cairo, while full of history and vibrant charm, is home to more than 18 million people, and living in and getting around the city can be maddening and frustrating. The government says the idea is to reduce congestion in Cairo, which is projected to double in population in the coming decades. An exact location was not announced, but the city is expected to be built east of Cairo. It will be closer to the Red Sea -- between two major highways -- the Suez and the Ain Sokhna roads. The ambitions are big. In addition to the new embassies and government buildings, it plans to have an international airport bigger than Heathrow, solar energy farms, 40,000 hotel rooms,  nearly 2,000 schools and 18 hospitals --  all linked together by over 6,000 miles of new roads. But if the dream is big, the bill will be bigger. The total cost is estimated at U.S. $45 billion, Minister of Housing Mostafa Madbouly announced at an economic development conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. The unveiling of the new capital was paired with a glitzy website with renderings showing a lush and technological urban scape of glass towers and pools. The plan is backed by a group that describes itself as \"a private real estate investment fund by global investors focused on investment and development partnerships\" led by Emirati developer Mohamed Alabbar. Alabbar made his name as the founder of Dubai's Emaar Properties, primarily known for developing the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Egypt is not the first country to plan on moving its capital from established big cities to rural greener pastures.  Myanmar has only recently completed its move from crumbling Yangon to the new city of Naypyidaw. Nigeria moved to Abuja in the 1990's, and Brazil carved its capital Brasilia out of the wilderness over 50 years ago. And then there was another crazy idea of building a capital on a square of swampland that seemed mainly to be a boondoggle for wealthy land speculators at the time. That city?

But Mrs May is also better liked than the London Mayor among those candidates on a ‘Future MPs Panel’, according to the survey conducted by Populus. Leading the charge: Theresa May (left) is a more likely Tory leader than Boris Johnson (right) a poll of future MPs has found . It found one in four of those questioned thought she would be the next party leader – whether there is a leadership election later this year in the wake of a Tory election defeat or in six years. Some 26 per cent of those asked backed Mrs May, compared to 22 per cent for Mr Johnson, and 12 per cent for Sajid Javid, rising star of the Tory Right, who is Culture Secretary. The poll will disappoint those Tories who want Chancellor George Osborne to succeed Mr Cameron, who did not register as a potential future leader. Mrs May is seen by allies as Britain’s Angela Merkel and is the longest serving home secretary in more than 50 years. She will challenge Mr Johnson – whom she is thought to regard as a ‘faintly ridiculous figure’ – if the Tories lose the election and Mr Cameron stands down. Mr Johnson is expected to return to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge, having been selected as the party’s candidate for the election, while continuing in his role as mayor.

President Vladimir Putin has accused Western spies of plotting to undermine his rule and trying to 'destabilise' Russia before the elections. Public organisations are being used by Western security services to achieve their own goals, the Russian president said at a meeting of the Federal Security Service earlier today. He vowed that Russia would stand firm in the face of what he described as attempts to isolate the country politically and economically following the Ukrainian crisis. In the speech he said: 'The attempts by Western security services to use public, non-governmental organisations and non-political groups for their own benefit, mostly to discredit the authorities and destabilise the situation in Russia, have not stopped. 'Actions are being planned for the time before the election campaigns in 2016 and 2018.' Putin approved a law to force non-governmental organisations that engage in 'political activity' to register with the Justice Ministry as 'foreign agents' and file a report to officials every quarter in 2012. Critics claimed it was a move designed to try and silence groups that criticised his human rights record. His new comments mean that Moscow will not relax their scrutiny of non-governmental groups that receive foreign funding. Putin added that he was always open to dialogue with the opposition - but was confident the country would come out as a winner in the standoff against the West. He said: 'The situation around our country will change for the better, but not because we will make concessions, bend down or trifle with someone.

'But it would be pointless to have debates with those who take orders from an outsider, in the interest of another country.'

An apparent lack of police control has led to some victims attempting to take justice into their own hands, sometimes with tragic consequences. The theft is often committed on motorbikes, which offer thieves an escape route. But this can end fatally when victims refusing to let go of their belongings are dragged to their death.

However, Mars and Ferrero eggs are up by 4.2 and 4.1 per cent respectively. And Thorntons' have stayed the same price on average. Trade magazine The Grocer, which reported the price drop, said: 'In terms of retailer activity, Morrisons has driven the decline by slashing the price of branded eggs by 7.3 per cent on average, while prices rose at Tesco and Sainsbury's - by 2.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent on average respectively - and dipped 0.4 per cent at Asda.

Pellegrini is under pressure to keep his job after watching his City side fall out of the title race . ‘It would be very difficult to find a more complete player than [James] Milner’ Pellegrini said. ‘There are players who are better technically. There are quicker players. 'There are players who head the ball better. But show me a player who does all the things that Milner does well and there isn’t one.' Milner has played 36 times for City this season in all competitions and contributed six goals.

Pellegrini added: ‘And whatever position I put him in he plays well: at full-back – which is the only place he doesn’t like playing– attacking midfield, wide, or as a striker. I used him this season as a forward and the team was scoring three goals a game. ‘You leave him on the bench and he is furious, but watch him during the game, encouraging and shouting. And in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes.

A former middle school math teacher from Pennsylvania has pleaded guilty to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students last year. Jessica Streeper, 34, a married mother of two from Doylestown, entered the plea Monday in Montgomery County Court to a felony charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Judge Garrett Page postponed sentencing until the defendant undergoes a sex offender evaluation and the probation office completes a background report. Streeper was a teacher at Eisenhower Science and Technology Leadership Academy in the Norristown Area School District. Prosecutors said in a criminal complaint that an eighth-grade student told them he had sex with Streeper last spring in her car and in her home. The disgraced educator could face a maximum sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison. She is currently out on $10,000 cash bail. Prosecutor Sophia Polites said it would be 'appropriate' to sentence the former educator to prison time, reported the Bucks County Courier Times. ‘Teachers are entrusted with the responsibility of teaching our children, making sure our children are safe,’ said Polites. ‘Teachers are role models. What this teacher did was destroy that trust.’ Wife and mother: The married mom of two admitted last year to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and sexting with him from her phone . Jessica Streeper was arrested in May 2014 after police in Norristown received an anonymous tip informing them that the eighth-grade math teacher was having a tryst with a male student. When the alleged victim, then age 14, was interviewed by detectives, he admitted to having sex with Jessica Streeper on seven occasions, including five times in her car. When investigators checked the teenager's cellphone, they found numerous 'sexts' that were exchanged between the married teacher and her underage lover. According to the criminal complaint, the illicit affairs lasted between April 1 and May 20, 2014. During Monday's court hearing, Judge Page informed the defendant that as a registered sex offender, she will have to report her address and place of employment to state police for the rest of her life.

It appears that the barrage of criticism received over the BBC’s adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s gothic novel Jamaica Inn is to blame for creating the fear factor. More than 2,000 viewers complained about poor sound quality and inaudible dialogue when Jamaica Inn was screened last April and the star of Poldark, Aidan Turner, has now confessed that he and the cast were alarmed by the backlash. Turner, 31, told the Radio Times: ‘I didn’t see Jamaica Inn but the fuss about it spooked us all a lot. ‘We started shooting a few weeks later and I can tell you all the actors were aiming for ten out of ten on enunciation. 'I’m doing posh RP [received pronunciation] anyway, so it didn’t affect me directly but I was scared, yes.’ Turner takes the role of British soldier Ross Poldark, who returns from fighting in the American War of Independence to find his fiancée Elizabeth Chenoweth, believing him to be dead, is set to marry his cousin. BBC bosses are hoping for a return of Poldark mania. Poldark is based on the novels by Winston Graham.

It’s not just the back four and the goalkeeper, we defend as a team. I don’t set out to be brutally honest but I’d struggle to say things any other way.’ City have won both their Premier League titles on the last day, but Hart added: ‘I’m not that bothered about topping previous seasons in terms of drama.

Jose Mourinho said club doctor Paco Biosca was against the idea of an operation but Costa may yet consider corrective surgery at the end of the season in an attempt to solve the hamstring problem which has nagged him for a year. Loic Remy, who came on for Costa at Hull and scored the winner, is not in the France squad and will have two weeks to convince Mourinho he deserves more game time. Didier Drogba did not travel to Hull but also expects to be available if Costa is not ready to face Stoke. ‘I know that Diego is the number one,’ said Remy. ‘But when the manager needs me, I give my best for him.’ Costa had scored Chelsea's second goal as they stormed into a 2-0 lead within 10 minutes on Sunday . Hull were able to draw level before half-time and when Costa was subbed off the scores were locked at 2-2 .", "completion": "response:\n\nSpain play Ukraine in a Euro 2016 qualifier before a  friendly against Holland .\nDiego Costa limped off with a hamstring injury against Hull on Sunday .\nThe striker will undergo tests on the injury in London on Monday .\nResults will be made available to the national team's medical staff .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Chelsea news ."}

Kevin McGill, a garbage collector in Sandy Springs, Georgia, had been sentenced to a total of 30 days in jail for violating the city's noise ordinance that states that \"trash collection must be conducted between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.\" He was cited one recent morning after starting work about 5 a.m. McGill said that when he appeared in court, he was \"stunned\" when he learned he'd have to serve time for collecting garbage too early. \"The solicitor said, 'It's automatic jail time,'\" McGill told CNN affiliate WSB. McGill said it was the first time he'd violated the ordinance, but the solicitor \"didn't want to hear nothing I had to say.\" \"I was shocked,\" McGill told WSB. City spokeswoman Sharon Kraun said McGill appeared in court with his employer and agreed to a plea deal, which included a 30-day jail sentence. The court said the sentence could be served on weekends, and Kraun confirmed Monday that McGill already spent two weekends behind bars. After news of McGill's punishment went viral, the solicitor's office announced Monday that prosecutors would amend his sentence, saying in a statement, \"The actions of the court with regards to Mr. McGill's sentence for violating the city's noise laws was disproportionate to a first-time offense.\" \"As such, the court has amended its sentence to time served and further probation (is) suspended,\" the statement said. Chief prosecutor Bill Riley told WSB that the jail sentence was his idea because, he said, \"fines don't seem to work.\" \"The only thing that seems to stop the activity is actually going to jail,\" McGill said. Still, McGill said being locked up with \"real criminals\" was hard, and so was being away from his family. \"I just want this to be over with,\" he told WSB before getting word of the \"time served\" adjustment. \"I'm away from my family, my wife, and she's got to take care of the two little boys and I have four dogs.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nKevin McGill was initially ordered to serve 30 days in jail for picking up trash too early in the morning .\nMcGill already began his sentence, doing two weekends behind bars .\nCity relents, letting him off with \"time served\" after story goes viral ."}

The blasts occurred in Maiduguri, the capital of the tumultuous Borno state, at the city's main market, a fish market and a bus station. Four suicide bombers -- three women and a man -- carried out the attacks, according to witnesses. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the bloodshed. But the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram has been behind many similar attacks in northern Nigeria and beyond, killing hundreds in recent months as part of its terrorist campaign to bring its twisted version of Sharia law to the region. Clement Adoda, a Borno state police spokesman, said at least 54 people were killed and another 139 wounded in the suicide attacks. Suleiman Bulunkutu said he and others involved in the rescue operation had taken about 50 bodies to the Maiduguri General Hospital morgue. \"This toll doesn't include those taken to three other hospitals,\" Bulunkutu said. \"Therefore, the‎ final (death) toll may be higher.\" In the first blast, a woman dressed in a hijab got off a motorized rickshaw and blew herself up outside the Baga Road fish market around 11:20 a.m. (5:20 a.m. ET), fish trader Mohammed Boni said. The next attack took place about an hour later outside Monday Market, the main one in the city, where people were lined up to go through security. Those measures -- in which people are checked for explosives and guns -- were set up because of the spate of Boko Haram attacks in the city and region. Two women joined the female security line, one of whom \"blew herself up, causing minimal casualty,\" said witness Abdulkarim Musa. Then, as people gathered to help, the second woman detonated her explosives, said Musa, who was waiting outside the market in the male security line. The third attack occurred at a bus station. \"He came in our midst near the bus station and pressed a remote device he was holding in his hand,\" a wounded survivor who requested anonymity for his personal safety said from Maiduguri General Hospital. Such attacks, sadly, are nothing new for Borno State, one of those hit hardest by Boko Haram and the Nigerian military's campaign to stop them. The terrorist group has not only bombed crowded markets but attacked churches and mosques, raided villages, and kidnapped people young and old -- most famously the more than 200 girls taken last April from a school in Chibok.", "completion": "response:\n\nPolice official: At least 54 are killed and 139 wounded .\n3 of the 4 suicide bombers were females, witnesses say .\nThe attack happened in a region terrorized by Boko Haram ."}

Headteacher Steve Esmond, his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their  stay at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort on the Caribbean island of St. John. The family were airlifted to separate hospitals in Philadelphia suffering major respiratory trauma, with 11th and ninth grade sons, Sean and Ryan, in critical care. Headteacher Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr. Theresa Devine, were on holiday with their two sons . The family was staying at the $800-a-night  Sirenusa Condominium Resort on the Caribbean island of St. John . It is believed the harmful chemical was used to disinfect a neighbouring suite at the complex the day the family arrived for their eight-night stay, 6ABC reported. The family's attorney, James Maron, said the Esmonds began to have seizures on Friday, and they were taken to island hospitals and airlifted back to the Philadelphia area by Monday. 'Their conditions, while serious, are stable and improving,' the attorney said in a statement issued to The News Journal. 'The boys remain in critical condition.' The odourless pesticide used inside a suite at the complex was reported to be methyl bromide, which is used to treat mould, insects and rodents. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are investigating whether the family was poisoned by a pesticide . According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the odourless pesticide can be fatal or cause serious central nervous system and respiratory system damage. As it is acutely toxic, use of the pesticide is restricted to outdoor use only in the United States. Investigators confirmed that the chemical was applied 'to deal with indoor bugs,' said Judith Enck, an administrator for the EPA, to USA Today. 'Their conditions, while serious, are stable and improving,' a statement from Maron's law office said. 'The boys remain in critical condition.' Steve Esmond is the administrator of Tatnall Middle School in Wilmington, Delaware, and his wife, Theresa, is a dentist. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa Condominium Resort, told 6ABC that it is aware that the family became seriously ill, but that the unit where they stayed was not treated with a pesticide. It said that pesticide was used to treat the unit immediately below the suite where the Esmonds were staying.", "completion": "response:\n\nEsmond family began to have seizures at their resort at US Virgin Islands .\nIt is believed methyl bromide was used at the Sirenusa Resort .\nUse of the chemical is restricted to outdoor use in America .\nParents are in a serious condition and teenage sons in a critical state ."}

The Prime Minister had promised to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the General Election. However, last month that vow was shattered when figures showed it had hit a record high. David Cameron’s pledge to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ is no longer taken seriously by the Office for Budget Responsibility . Home Secretary Theresa May later insisted the Tories would restate the failed target to slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they returned to Government. But yesterday the OBR heaped embarrassment on ministers by criticising the prediction. In a document published alongside the Budget, it said its previous forecasts had been ‘underpinned by the assumption’ that net migration – the measure of how many people have come into Britain minus those who have left – would be 105,000 by 2019. Theresa May said Tories would slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they stayed in power . It stated: ‘A reduction over time seems consistent with the international environment and with the Government’s declared efforts to reduce it.’ But in a blow to Mr Cameron, it added: ‘In light of recent evidence, it no longer seems central to assume it will decline so steeply.’ Instead, it said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’. On taking power in 2010, Mr Cameron pledged to bring the politically-sensitive net migration figure below 100,000. But last month the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the EU of 190,000. Downing Street described the figures as a ‘disappointment’ but also a reflection of a growing economy. The highest number previously recorded was 600,000 in September 2010. When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street in May 2010 net migration was running at 244,000. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘David Cameron’s “no ifs, no buts” pledge on net migration is in complete tatters; not even the Office of Budget Responsibility believes the Prime Minister’s promise any more and are now planning for it to be broken. ‘If you needed any more evidence that this government simply can’t be trusted to deliver their promises on immigration, this is it.’", "completion": "response:\n\nPM promised to reduce net migration to ‘tens of thousands’ by the election .\nBut vow was shattered when figures last month showed it hit record high .\nTheresa May then vowed to cut number to 100,000 if Tories stay in power .\nBut OBR said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’"}

Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools and children’s services, said saving youngsters from exploitation required ‘political and moral courage’ on the part of local leaders. ‘They must never allow misguided beliefs about the impact for certain ethnic and cultural groups to get in the way of confronting this horrific abuse wherever it occurs,’ he added. His warning came amid the row over the failure of social workers, politicians or police to act against gangs of mostly Pakistani men who exploited hundreds of children in Rotherham and Oxford. An inquiry last month said Rotherham councillors shied away from the issue for fear of being accused of disturbing ‘community cohesion’. It added: ‘By failing to take action against the Pakistani heritage male perpetrators of child sexual exploitation in the borough, the council has inadvertently fuelled the far-Right.’ Last week an inquiry into a similar scandal in Oxford, carried out by the head of the local safeguarding board, said there was ‘no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities’. But the Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner accused it of ‘pulling its punches’. Sir Michael’s warning was contained in an Ofsted report that found most local councils charged with looking after children’s safety are failing at the job. Only ten out of 43 inspected over the course of a year were found to give a good standard of care and protection.

Sir Michael said youngsters who go missing from children’s homes while in council care are disproportionately at risk of abuse but social workers in some areas still fail to take notice of them.

Manchester United will delay making a decision over Radamel Falcao's future until the end of the season . Falcao has just over three months to convince Louis van Gaal that he is worthy of a £43m transfer fee . The 29-year-old, once one of the most feared strikers in the game, has struggled for form at United since he made the switch from Monaco in the summer. He suffered a serious cruciate ligament injury last January that saw him miss the World Cup and some have questioned whether he can return to the same level. Falcao penned a season-long deal with United but has scored just four goals in 20 appearances - a record that would appear to scupper any chances of his agreement being made permanent. However, an injury to Robin van Persie means Falcao is likely to get more chances to show manager Louis van Gaal why he should keep him at the end of the season. The Colombia international has scored four Premier League goals since joining from Monaco . Falcao is expected to benefit from an injury to Manchester United team-mate Robin van Persie .", "completion": "response:\n\nMan United will make decision over Radamel Falcao's future in summer .\nReports in France suggested United had rejected chance to sign striker .\nFalcao has scored four goals for United since joining on season-long loan .\nAlan Shearer: Falcao is too easy to play against .\nClick here for all the latest news surrounding Manchester United ."}

A man who propositioned schoolgirls in the street while high on unleaded petrol is facing jail after breaching an ASBO banning him from drinking the fuel. Robert Stephens was found drunkenly staggering around a petrol station having bought a gallon of unleaded fuel less than eight hours after being released from prison for a string of offences. The 23-year-old, who is addicted to drinking and sniffing gasoline, was first handed an ASBO banning him from large swathes of his home city following a bizarre drunken outburst during which he taunted unsuspecting women with sexual jibes. This involved approaching two schoolgirls and saying to them: 'If you're old enough to smoke you're old enough to suck my d***'. On the same day he violently threatened his grandfather. He was also issued with an ASBO banning him from drinking petrol after investigators noted the connection between the habit and his offences. In court, one official said: 'Stephens is known to drink and sniff petrol and during his spree of offences it was noted by some witnesses that he smelled strongly of petrol. 'His presence within the exclusion area coupled with his intoxication and purchase of petrol represents a significantly high risk of serious offences being committed. 'It was fortuitous that police were in the area and able to apprehend Stephens before more serious offences were committed.'

It is meant to be BBC television’s flagship current affairs programme. But, for some, Newsnight appeared to be more reminiscent of school-set comedy St Trinian’s. Emily Maitlis’s outfit on Wednesday night – complete with spotty tie, waistcoat and rolled up shirt sleeves – raised more than a few eyebrows on social networking site Twitter. The BBC2 programme was watched by 830,000 people but it was the 44-year-old’s unusual outfit choice that sparked discussion and drew attention away from what was meant to be the programme’s top story. The leading segment was intended as a serious discussion about the announcement by the BBC that Jeremy Clarkson’s contract would not be renewed following a ‘fracas’ with producer Oisin Tymon. Miss Maitlis interviewed Alan Yentob, the BBC’s creative director and presenter of arts show Imagine, about the decision. Mr Yentob’s remarks on the programme were also criticised as elitist. One viewer tweeted: ‘Why is Emily Maitlis dressed as if she has escaped from the sets of St Trinian’s, refusing to play the extra.’ Another added: ‘Of course we all adore Emily Maitlis almost as much as she adores herself but isn’t the ravaged St Trinian’s schoolgirl look a tad de trop?’ A third wrote: ‘Emily Maitlis is wearing a strange outfit this eve, part off duty city boy, part pirate.’ This is not the first time the journalist’s wardrobe has drawn comments.

Initial reports to police indicate that nine people, including four attackers, were killed after gunmen in military uniforms attacked the house of the former Somali parliament speaker and current president of the newly established southwest regional administration, said Col. Mahad Abdi, a Somali police officer. The attack began when a car bomb detonated at the gate of the state palace in Baidoa city, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of the capital, Mogadishu. Heavy gunfire broke out between Somali troops backed by Ethiopian forces inside the house of the regional president, Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. Explosions and gunfire were still going on over an hour after the initial assault, Abdi said. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack. A broadcast by the group's official radio station, Andulus, said that Al-Shabaab gunmen had entered the regional president's house and killed seven Ethiopian soldiers. The African Union's special representative for Somalia, Ambassador Maman S.

Preliminary information indicates the explosion at Zasyadko mine was caused by methane gas, according to DAN, the official news agency for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). \"This did not happen because of shelling,\" an emergency services official told the news agency. The explosion occurred just before 6 a.m. local time, when 230 people were at the mine, the official website for separatist-controlled Donetsk city said. Of those, 157 were evacuated in the initial hours after the blast, including 14 injured and one dead, according to the website. Fifteen rescue teams are working at the scene, it said. Zasyadko mine is one of the most dangerous in terms of methane in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform, which reported that 240 people had died at the mine since 1999 -- 101 miners were killed in a single accident in 2007. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, speaking at a Cabinet meeting, accused the pro-Russian separatists who control the area of denying Ukrainian rescue teams access to the site, Ukrinform reported. He urged Russia to tell the separatists to allow in the rescue workers. \"You took millions of Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk hostage and are now brutalizing miners' families by not letting in help,\" Ukrinform quoted him as saying. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also called for rescuers to be allowed in. \"I demand Ukrainian rescue workers and investigators to be granted access at the site of the tragedy,\" he tweeted. However, DPR representative Denis Pushilin said Ukraine had not offered help with the rescue, and the DPR will ask Russia or separatist authorities in Luhansk for help if needed, according to the separatists' news agency. Separatist leader Aleksandr Zakharchenko issued an order to close the mine a month ago, but managers ignored the order because the mine legally belongs to Ukraine, Ukrinform cited the separatist news agency as saying. A shaky ceasefire is currently in place in Donetsk and the neighboring Luhansk region, the center of a months-long conflict between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces.

Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said all possible causes were under investigation, including terrorism. Trams and subways were idled in Istanbul -- with more than 14 million inhabitants, the largest city in the country and the fifth largest in the world. Homes and offices were left without electricity. \"I am sitting in my apartment,\" CNN producer Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul. \"No lights. No electricity.\" The capital, Ankara, some 250 miles from Istanbul, also was affected. The outage extended to 45 of Turkey's 81 provinces. The semiofficial Anadolu Agency quoted Energy Minister Taner Yildiz as saying the cause of the outage was unknown. Yildiz, speaking during a visit to Slovakia, said he could neither confirm nor deny that a cyberattack had triggered the blackout, the Anadolu Agency reported. Flightradar24, which maps real-time flight data on the Internet, tweeted that the outage was \"affecting flights,\" and said 11 of its 16 air traffic monitoring systems receivers -- as distinct from the country's air traffic control system -- were not working. The Turkish Electricity Transmission Co. blamed the outage on a problem with transmission lines, Anadolu Agency reported. The utility said an investigation was in progress, as were efforts to restore power, the news agency said. The outage began at 10:36 a.m. (3:36 a.m. ET). Nearly two hours later, according to Anadolu Agency, about 15% of the power had been restored to Istanbul and Ankara, including in some subway stations. Power also was beginning to flow again to a number of provinces that had been cut off, the agency reported. By midafternoon, Yildiz said, 90% of Istanbul's power had been restored. \"Crowded places such as metro stations have been given electricity, and we believe the rest of the country should be fully powered shortly,\" he said.

Users have nicknamed the creature Catzilla, Kat Kong and Fluffy Destroyer of Worlds. Others have suggested it would make a great horror movie. Disappointingly, or doubtless to some people's relief, the photo actually shows a normal-sized kitten playfully exploring the inside of a meticulously detailed dollhouse. Hear me roar! The photo of a giant cat destroying a house is actually a kitten playing in a dollhouse . The photo was taken by Cade Ritter, 18, of Austin, Texas, in an effort to get fostered kittens adopted into permanent homes. Ritter, a photography student at Rice University in Houston, took a series of photos at home a few years ago when his family fostered a litter of five kittens with the help of Austin Pets Alive, he told ABC. 'As people started adopting them, my mom thought it would be a good advertisement for the remaining kittens to have a little photo-shoot.' The kitten in the picture was the wildest out of the litter, but was eventually adopted. Ritter kept one of the cats, whom he named Sophie. The photo came about when Ritter and his mom, Austin-based artist Barbara Atwell, decided to use a dollhouse Ritter's great-grandfather had built by hand many years before. 'It's quite the amazing piece of carpentry,' Ritter said. 'It even has a working light system.' Users on Reddit were as impressed by the dollhouse as they were amused by the photo. The general consensus was that  the combination is a winning one. 'I just realized that as a cat owner, I now have a valid reason to buy a dollhouse,' said one user. The photos were taken by Cade Ritter of Austin, Texas, a few years ago to help find foster homes for a litter of five kittens .

The Blues were eliminated from the competition after a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night sent Paris Saint-Germain through to the quarter finals on away goals.

Because you may not have any gefilte fish at your table on Passover, which starts at sundown on April 3. February's record cold temperatures are to blame for the shortage of fish ingredients, reported Erica Marcus, a food writer at Newsday, the Long Island, New York, newspaper. \"The traditional Passover appetizer is made from ground whitefish, carp and yellow pike,\" Marcus wrote. \"All three are freshwater fish from the Upper Midwest, and all three are in short supply this spring because the Great Lakes are still covered with ice.\" While some restaurants reported having no supply issues, it may be a different story for the home cook. There's great debate within the Jewish community about the flavor of the classic gefilte fish dish, which isn't always the tastiest food at the table. \"I've never seen what all the fuss is about,\" Marcus told CNN. \"It's about as challenging a taste as tuna fish salad.\" The fishing boats just can't sail or fish on frozen lakes. Many of the Great Lakes are still partially frozen over, according to fisheries expert Ronald Kinnunen, an educator with Michigan State University's Sea Grant Extension Program. \"Nobody's getting their fishing boats out,\"  Kinnunen said. \"I'm looking at the satellite images and Lake Superior's half covered in ice,\" he said. It's still iced over at the Mackinac Bridge, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan come together at the Straits of Mackinac, he added. Blame an early Passover this year. Next year, it will likely be better for fishing. Passover doesn't start until sunset on April 22, much later in the month. The fish dish is not a religious requirement of the Seder dinner, but don't try telling that to cooks searching for the right ingredients for their classic recipes. If your mother or other host is mourning not having the dish at the table this year, offer to make chicken Kotletky or another offering from CNN Eatocracy's list of Passover recipes from around the world.", "completion": "response:\n\nCold temperatures are to blame for limited supply of freshwater fish .\nSome Passover hosts may not have any gefilte fish on the table ."}

While police are happy with the early kick-off time, they are aware of the various elements which could potentially turn things ugly but remain confident they can deal with any situations. In November, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) deployed around 400 officers for the Manchester derby, which the previously-banned hooligans were also able to attend.

Herrera celebrates after scoring the opening goal during their FA Cup third round match with Yeovil Town .

He has got a lot of qualities really, it’s just getting them out of him on a consistent basis. But he has got that in his locker, maybe it’s just taken him and a few of the new signings time to adapt to the Premier League.'

The details emerged this morning as Rangers released financial results which showed the club had made losses after tax of £2.89m for the six-month period to 31 December 2014. Interim chairman Paul Murray described the accounts as 'disappointing'. Haris Vuckic celebrates after scoring in Rangers' 4-1 victory against Cowdenbeath on Saturday . This arrangement with Newcastle was part of a deal struck by the previous board for five fringe players - Gael Bigirimana, Haris Vuckic, Kevin Mbabu, Remie Streete and Shane Ferguson. Only Vuckic has made any sort of impact for the Ibrox club so far. Indeed three of the five players who signed the loan agreements have yet to kick a ball for Rangers, who are currently second in the Championship and can only now be promoted through the play-offs. The prize money for finishing as runners-up in the second tier is £342,000. Despite promotion to the Championship, revenue fell £100,000 to £13.1m, though the club earned £1.3m from hosting the Commonwealth Games rugby sevens. Sponsorship revenue also dropped, falling by £0.3m to £0.4m. Loan signings Vuckic (centre), Gael Bigirimana (left) and Remie Streete are unveiled at Murray Park last month . Murray, who along with Dave King and John Gilligan, ousted the previous board, said: 'The new directors have been in place only a matter of weeks but have already started to repair the damage caused through recent years of neglect and disrespect for this club, its people and its history. 'The mismanagement of the club in recent years has been simply staggering. 'As the Interim Accounts prove, the new board has inherited major problems but while campaigning for change we all knew the club would be in need of major restructuring and repair on all fronts. Paul Murray (left) and Dave King are pictured back at Ibrox after the EGM earlier this month . 'We can and we will return this club to a strong and profitable footing through strategic planning, investment and re-engagement with all of our stakeholders. 'Too many of them have been lost or disenfranchised because of successive failings by a series of directors over the last four years in particular.

It is one of the world’s strangest birds, with a huge domed bill, a 6ft wingspan and a call that sounds like maniacal laughter as it echoes across the Borneo rainforest. But the helmeted hornbill is being driven towards extinction – by a surge in the black-market demand for its ivory in China. The bird – dubbed ‘the farmer of the rainforest’ for its vital seed-spreading role – has become the latest victim of organised wildlife crime, according to a report to be published this week by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA). Its ivory is now worth three times more than that of elephants, and illegal poaching is spiralling out of control. Hornbill expert Yoki Hadiprakarsa warned: ‘If no one pays attention, this bird is going to become extinct.’ The illegal trade is being fuelled by the desires of China’s wealthy middle classes for carved ivory items. With ‘white’ elephant ivory and rhino horn becoming more scarce, the EIA found traffickers were dealing instead in ‘red’ ivory from a hornbill casque. This now sells for as much as £4,000 a kilo – three times the price of elephant ivory. There are no reliable estimates of the impact of poaching on populations across the hornbills’ historic range of Borneo, Sumatra and the Malaysian peninsula, but in one region alone, the Kalimantan, an estimated 6,000 birds are killed every year. Mr Hadiprakarsa, director of the Indonesian Hornbill Conservation Society, said: 'A few years ago helmeted hornbills were common in the West Kalimantan, but on my last visit I didn't see any and local villagers said they hadn't either. 'Hunters are now pushing into the remotest areas of the forest.’ The illegal trade in ivory from the birds is being fuelled by the desires of China’s wealthy middle classes for carved ivory items . Chinese visitors look at souvenirs made from ivory at a market in Angola. The ivory, which comes from helmeted hornbills, is three times the price of that of an elephant . Poachers, who shoot then decapitate the birds, often return from expeditions with as many as 20 hornbill heads. These are then sold for up to £300 each to middle men or direct to smugglers exporting to Hong Kong and China. EIA campaigner Debbie Banks said: ‘What is sickening is this trade has nothing to do with tradition or medicine – it’s purely about demand for luxury vanity products.’", "completion": "response:\n\nThe helmeted hornbill of the Borneo rainforest is being driven to extinction .\nIt is due to a surge in the black-market demand for its ivory in China .\nThe ivory is now worth three times more than that of elephants .\nReport says the bird is the latest victim of organised wildlife crime ."}

The written reasons for Evans' six-match ban were released by the FA on Thursday. The Manchester United defender and Newcastle striker Cisse were both charged after spitting at each other during the Red Devils' 1-0 victory on March 4 in an incident missed by referee Anthony Taylor. Newcastle's Papiss Cisse and Manchester United's Jonny Evans squared at St James' Park last week . Cisse has been banned for seven games, while Evans has received a six game suspension . Cisse accepted the charge and a seven-match ban - one extra because of a previous offence this season - but Evans insisted he had not intended to spit at the striker and contested it. The three members of the regulatory commission accepted 27-year-old Evans was the only person who could know his intent, but stated: 'It is clear that Mr Evans is looking directly and indeed aggressively at Mr Cisse. His lips are 'pursed' and he is close to Mr Cisse. 'If he was, as alleged to be the case, a person who 'habitually spits', then the commission were concerned as to why he did not turn his head away from Mr Cisse when so spitting. 'If that had been a family member or indeed another team member or his manager in front and below him would he still have carried out the same manoeuvre? Evans' actions have been described as 'simply disgusting' by the FA's regulatory committee . Both Evans and Cisse were charged and banned by the FA for spitting, but Cisse admitted the offence . 'Mr Evans had (and has) a duty of care, if spitting for whatever reason, not to direct the same in the general direction of an opponent, or indeed anyone else. The video clips clearly show that he failed in his duty of care. 'There may, in some quarters, be substantial sympathy for Mr Evans, but the video evidence shows that he did what he did, and the ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting and should not be allowed in any walk of life, let alone on any football field.' The written report also reveals Manchester United questioned the length of the suspension but the commission did not consider there were any 'truly exceptional' circumstances to reduce it from the standard six matches.", "completion": "response:\n\nJonny Evans was banned for six games for spitting at Papiss Cisse .\nFA commission which found him guilty have published written reasons .\nReport said Evans was 'looking directly and indeed aggressively at Cisse'\n'The ordinary man in the street will find his action to be simply disgusting'"}

Labour is four points ahead of the Conservatives, but would be out of sight by now if the party had a better leader than Ed Miliband. Astonishingly, if the Election was a presidential style head to head, more than one in eight Labour voters would choose Mr Cameron. The Budget has failed to provide a Tory bounce – but if the economy stays on track until the Election, David Cameron (pictured) could still win . A total of 13 per cent of Labour supporters opted for Cameron, but only 2 per cent of Tories choose Miliband. The Survation poll carried out for The Mail on Sunday shows Labour on 34 points, the Tories on 30, Ukip on 17 and the Lib Dems on ten. A total of 1,008 people took part in the online survey on Friday and Saturday. Asked to choose between the Tories and Labour, Labour clearly wins. But when voters are asked to choose between Cameron and Miliband, Cameron wins by 42 per cent to 33. There have recently been claims by some Tory MPs that the Budget was ‘too dull’, and Australian-born Election guru Lynton Crosby has been criticised by Ministers including Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith for ‘lack of vision’. But the poll suggests that his strategy, which relies on a late pro-Tory swing by voters worried that Labour will wreck the recovery, could yet work. Labour is four points ahead of the Conservatives, but would be out of sight by now if the party had a better leader than Ed Miliband, the poll shows . A total of 16 per cent of non-Tory voters say they could still change their mind and vote Conservative if the economy stays on track.

Cherie Blair is set to join Renault next month to improve the diversity on its board, it has been revealed. The French car manufacturer has approached the well-known women’s rights activist as it attempts to improve its female representation. Mother-of-four Mrs Blair, 60, has been concentrating on her legal and charity work since her 61-year-old husband Tony left the office of prime minister in 2007. Renault - the world’s fourth biggest car maker by sales through its alliance with Nissan - said the barrister would also add helpful experience in employment and human rights law. Mrs Blair, who ‘works closely’ with more than 20 charities according to her website, has never previously been appointed to a French corporation, reported The Daily Telegraph. Last year she left human rights practice Matrix Chambers to join the international legal consultancy firm Omnia Stategy, which she co-founded four years ago. Mrs Blair, who was born into a working-class family in Liverpool, also founded the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, which helps female entrepreneurs in the developing world. A quota system exists in France to demand that women make up 20 per cent of board members – a figure that will rise to 40 per cent in 2017. Four of Renault’s current 19-member board are women. Other prominent women in the male-dominated industry include Ursula Piëch of Volkswagen, Mary Barra of General Motors and Patience Wheatcroft of Fiat Chrysler, reported the Financial Times.

But when Rory McIlroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake Friday, he might as well have been channeling the much loved Adam Sandler character.

McIlroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournament and eight shots off the pace set by leader JB Holmes. While an improvement on last weeks performance at the Honda Classic event, where he failed to make the cut, the Northern Irishman's frustration with elements of his game was still clear. \"I think every golfer feels it because I don't hit shots like the one I hit on 8 on the range,\" he said. \"That's what really bothers me, the fact that I get out on the course and I hit shots that I'm not seeing when I'm in a more relaxed environment. \"So it's a little bit of mental, a little bit of physical. It's just everything is not quite matching up.\" Elsewhere on the course, Ryan Holmes scored a two-under-par 71 to remain in second position overall, two shots behind Holmes.

Rescuers found the toddler Saturday hanging upside down in the car, which had crashed into a frigid Utah river a day before. Lily's mother, Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck, died in the crash that had landed their car on its roof in the Spanish Fork River. She was 25. Deven Trafny, 34, was out of town on a job at the time of the accident, CNN affiliate KUTV reported. He rushed to his daughter's side as soon as he heard. \"(I) came in, I put my finger in her hand, and I told her her Dad was here, and I love her,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"I haven't left her bedside since, and I've just been here just sitting next to her waiting for her to get better so she can come home.\" Trafny said that Lily is awake and has been singing nursery rhymes.

The angler waded into the river around noon, then noticed the car wheels-up in the water. The fisherman called emergency dispatch. The water was so cold that, when the rescue was over, seven of the men involved had to be treated for hypothermia. They heaved the car onto its side and saw Groesbeck in the driver's seat. It was clear to them that she was dead. Lily was still strapped into her seat, where she may have been for 14 hours, if the wreck occurred at about 10:30 Friday night, as police believe. Trafny described Groesbeck as the love of his life, according to KUTV: \"I'm going to miss her a lot.

The Knoxville Baptist Tabernacle posted the controversial message, but took it down after experiencing some backlash. Before it was removed, the marquee read: 'Remember Satan was the first to demand equal rights.' Scroll down for video . The Knoxville Baptist Tabernacle posted the controversial message (pictured), but then took it down later . Many people felt the sign was meant to offend those who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender . Pastor Tony Greene said the message on the marquee was 'not a statement against any one group in particular' After the message was posted, it began being shared on the Facebook and Twitter pages of WATE. Many people felt the sign was meant to offend individuals who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender, but the Tabernacle's pastor said that was not the case. Pastor Tony Greene said: 'Our sign referencing Satan demanding his equal rights to ascend into the heavens and be God was simply all about that individual. 'It was not a statement against any one group in particular, you know what about the rights of the unborn babies, the rights of children, the rights of everyone?' Some did not buy Greene's explanation. Andy Henry told WBIR: 'It's clearly a sign that was meant to offend a particular community - the LGBT community. 'Because of (the church's) lack of foresight, they ended up offending everybody who had ever fought for equality or civil rights in general.' The sign was changed to read: 'Glad you reading, did not intend to offend, we all need Christ.' Greene said: 'We are a diversity congregation of people. 'We've reached people that know us and know our stand in this community know what we've done. 'My heart breaks in the dividedness of our country.' The Tabernacle 'not only supports soul-winning at home, but also supports evangelism and church-planting in America and around the world', according to its website. The church has missions in Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Haiti, Ireland and Scotland.

Letters written in 1941 reveal Churchill planned to gift the US a copy of the Magna Carta to persuade them to join World War Two, noting that Americans desire 'tangible evidence of their European background' The Magna Carta, which was issued by King John in 1215 establishing the rule of law and handing rights to his subjects, is also seen as a precursor to the American Constitution.

The US government had already signed a deal sending vast amounts of aid money over to their struggling allies in Europe, but were still reticent about engaging in the fighting themselves. According to the letters, which go on display at the British Library from this Friday, the Americans saw the British as 'cold-blooded', 'calculating' people who failed 'to say it with flowers' The historic document (pictured), which signed over righta King John's people, is viewed as a precursor to the American constitution, and so was viewed as a generous gift .

'He will give the shirt off his back for friendship.' Officials even scheduled June 15 of that year as the day for the document to be handed over, but the deal fell through for unspecified reasons.

It was, undoubtedly, a brilliant piece of play from the Brazilian, but immediately the inquest began as to how Chelsea had allowed the centre back so much space. The answer, it seems, is that captain John Terry, rather than marking his opponent, was tussling with his central defensive partner as the corner came in.

As part of CNN's Instant Startups series, CNNMoney correspondent Laurie Segall reached out to Meerkat's Ben Rubin with some questions. And he agreed to answer them -- on Meerkat, of course. You can see a few moments from the chat in the video above. Rubin is actually the co-founder and chief executive of Life On Air Inc., a livestreaming company with many tentacles. But recently Rubin decided to dedicate his entire team to work on Meerkat after the app's popularity exploded. Still, Rubin said, he doesn't consider the app an \"instant startup\" per se. It took years of work to reach this moment, he said. The half-hour chat between Rubin and Segall was informative and entertaining. Several people said it broke their record for the longest Meerkat stream they had ever watched.

Rubin also revealed who he'd like most to join in the fun. Startup wannabes also got some great advice from this successful entrepreneur.

The 1891 painting, titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun', was largely unknown and its origin had never been verified. But a team of researchers from the University of Jyväskylä in Finland painstakingly  unearthed the signature. Scroll down for video . An 1891 oil painting - titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun' - has been proven to be one of Claude Monet's despite the artist painting over his own signature . The painting has been owned by the Gösta Serlachius Fine Arts Foundation, also in Finland, for more than 50 years. It is thought to be part of a wider series by Monet with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season. The painting was verified after a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work. This allowed researchers to see different layers  including a previous signature by  Monet. It is thought to be part of a wider series by Monet (above) with all the pieces illustrating stacks of hay in fields after the harvest season . Ilkka Pölönen, a researcher, said the camera scans one 'line' at a time. He told ArtDaily: 'When the camera is moved using the scanner an image of the whole picture can be obtained.' The Fine Arts Foundation said the artwork  is the first Monet painting to be held in a Finnish public collection. The other paintings from the series are held at various galleries including the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Scotland and the J. Paul Getty Museum in California. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a non-destructive technique, which can identify the presence of certain pigments. It was first used in the 1940s and applied to paintings in the 1950s. The technique involves bombarding the artwork with x-rays so powerful that they cause atoms in the picture’s layers to emit ‘florescent’ x-rays of their own. XRF can be used to identify the colours of hidden paintings or to see earlier versions of famous pieces. By mapping the x-rays of copper, for blue and green, iron, for yellow, orange and brown, and mercury, for red, scientists can see full-colour 'maps' of previous versions. In this case a special camera was used to examine the composition of the work. This allowed researchers to see different layers  including a previous signature - verifying that the painting was by Monet.", "completion": "response:\n\nOil-painting titled 'A Haystack in the Evening Sun' is from 1891 .\nResearchers in Finland used special technique to unearth signature ."}

Edinson Cavani levelled the tie at the Parc des Princes with his second-half strike cancelling out Branislav Ivanovic's away goal - and Chelsea certainly owed some of the credit for a decent result to goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Van der Garde won the challenge to get a spot in Sunday's race with Swiss F1 team Sauber, who removed him as a driver late last year despite having a contract. Justice Clyde Croft in the Supreme Court of Victoria said Van der Garde's application was successful. Giedo van der Garde, pictured at testing in 2014 was the reserve driver for Sauber last season . Lawyers for Sauber argued Van der Garde was an unacceptable risk because he wasn't trained in the team's car and he did not have a custom seat, but van der Garde's lawyer Tom Clarke said his client was ready to work with the team to get a seat fitted before racing begins. Sauber said in a statement 'the outcome is unfortunately not as expected.' 'We are disappointed with this decision and now need to take time to understand what it means and the impact it will have on the start of our season,' Sauber team chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn said. 'What we cannot do is jeopardize the safety of our team, or any other driver on the track, by having an unprepared driver in a car that has now been tailored to two other assigned drivers.' But Van der Garde said outside court he was ready to race. Practice begins Friday. 'I'm very fit and very strong. I'm looking forward to going back to the team, work hard and do our best for the weekend,' he said. 'I'm the fittest ever. I've been training the last three months flat out.' Van der Garde also said that despite the legal battle, he was keen to work with Sauber again. Dutch driver  claimed he was offered a race seat for the 2015 campaign but Sauber reneged on deal . 'I'm looking forward to going back to the team. I had a very good relationship, I still have a very good relationship, with the team,' he said. One of Sauber's current drivers, Marcus Ericsson or Felipe Nasr, would have to miss out for Van der Garde to race in one of the two team cars. 'Well, I think it's up to them what they're going to do, and up to the team. It's not my thing,' he said.

A leading children’s charity is facing a crisis after three of its directors resigned amid an apparent row over funding, it was revealed yesterday. Kids Company has received around £30 million of public money since 2008 and has celebrity backers including rock group Coldplay, businessman Sir Richard Branson and Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Set up by Camila Batmanghelidjh in 1996, it supports 36,000 vulnerable children in London, Bristol and Liverpool and has been championed by Prince Charles and David Cameron. But concerns about the way the charity is run are understood to have led some senior managers to raise issues with its board of trustees. The resignations of interim finance director Diane Hamilton, human resources chief Adrian Stones and director of development Mandy Lloyd then followed. A statement from Kids Company said: ‘It was with great regret that they felt unable to continue working within the organisation because of the uncertainty of funding, which led to high levels of stress in the workplace which was unsustainable.’ But a source close to the directors reportedly said: ‘These departures are a direct result of these employees’ doubts about the future of Kids Company ... The trustees were told of their doubts but they don’t seem to have reacted at all.’ Miss Batmanghelidjh, a trained psychotherapist, became known as ‘Mother Camila of Camberwell’ for her work with some of South London’s most disadvantaged children. Michael Gove is said to have tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012 . Born in Iran, she is known for her colourful style. In 2013 she was named one of Britain’s 100 most powerful women by Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour and appointed a CBE. The Sunday Times reported that the resignations were revealed as she denied persuading Mr Cameron to intervene after then education secretary Michael Gove tried to prevent a grant of up to £8 million being given to the charity in 2012. Miss Batmanghelidjh said that an independent audit in 2014 showed ‘the charity was well run but lacked funding’.

The baby girl, who has yet to be named, was born Thursday in a village in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh . 'My sister-in-law gave birth to a girl at 7:00 a.m. and her face looks exactly like Lord Ganesha. Everybody is saying she is an incarnation of the God,' the baby's aunt Rajani told ANI. 'This is why whoever hears about her is coming here to get a glimpse of the baby and are making whatever offerings possible.' The girl comes from a poor family with her father, a vegetable vendor who earns 250 rupee ($5.17) per day, hoping his daughter's birth will bring the family better luck, the Times of India reported. She has three healthy older siblings and lives in a small house in the northern Indian village. Doctors said the girl's protrusion was most likely due to a gene mutation, caused by malnutrition and pollution.

When they asked for entries, organisers expected a modest response. Yesterday it emerged that more than 800 schools had applied for a share of a £25,000 book fund. World Book Day director Kirsten Grant said the response was proof of the continuing demand for books, despite the popularity of e-readers. ‘World Book Day is all about the celebration of traditional books,’ she said. ‘For children there is still that wonderful thing of sitting down with their parents and reading a book and that amazing bond it performs. 'Children don’t want physical books to be replaced, they already spend so much time on the internet and devices so books actually provide them with a break from that.' To earn a share of the fund, which was donated by best-selling crime author James Patterson, schools were asked to respond to the statement: Why I can’t live without books. Miss Grant and a panel of judges then drew up a shortlist, selected for their creativity and passion for books. The £10,000 first prize went to Hexthorpe Primary in Doncaster. Six other schools split the remaining £15,000 between themselves. She added: ‘World Book Day is all about the celebration of traditional books. Children can go into a bookshop with a £1 World Book Day token and get an actual physical book. 'So many children don’t have access to physical books so this is an opportunity for them to get one. There is definitely a huge demand. 'School libraries are suffering, book budgets in schools are being slashed, so this is a brilliant way to counter that.’ Huge response: More than 800 schools applied for a share of a £25,000 book fund as part of World Book Day . Mr Patterson, who has also written several children’s books and has donated another £25,000 for an award fund next year, said: ‘Libraries are shutting their doors left and right. 'I firmly believe that every child needs access to a school library, which is why I’m supporting WoBoD: they encourage a love of reading in our children that we can’t afford to lose. ‘Reading is one of the building blocks of life and can take you to another world.

Set up by UNESCO, an agency of the United Nations, it aims to encourage children to buy books by giving every school child given £1 book token.", "completion": "response:\n\nHuge response shows books still popularity despite e-readers .\nChildren had to answer question 'Why I can't live without books'\nFund set up by bestselling crime author James Patterson ."}

Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, was among those killed in the attack at the the Makka Al Mukarama hotel in Mogadishu, the Somali government said. The attack began around 5 p.m. when a car bomb exploded at the hotel's entrance, according to witness Aden Hussein, who said he was meters away from the hotel when the blast happened. Gunmen then went inside the hotel, shooting people, Hussein said. One of the attackers, wearing a belt with explosives, blew himself up inside the hotel, police Capt. Ahmed Abdi said . A few hours after the assault began, state-run media reported that security forces stormed the building and killed the remaining assailants. The attackers killed at least six people, Abdi said. The hotel, which is along a highway leading to the country's presidential palace, is popular with lawmakers, journalists and business people. An Al-Shabaab spokesman, Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab, told CNN that the group was behind the attack. He said Al-Shabaab fighters were conducting an operation at the hotel against what he said were spies and government officials. Al-Shabaab has been active in Somalia for years. Initially its goal was implementing a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia, by warring against the Somali government. It has since shifted its focus to launching terror attacks in Somalia and beyond. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu.

The sports broadcaster, 44, used a step-counting machine as she went on a diet – and lost an impressive 20lb in under three months. Miss Balding said the weight loss had boosted her self-esteem. Scroll down for video . Sports broadcaster Clare Balding (pictured with partner Alice Arnold earlier this week) used a step-counting machine and went on a diet – and lost an impressive 20lb in under three months . ‘I’m more confident about my body now. I just think, “Get on with it, no one’s looking.” 'I’m less conscious of the things that don’t matter so much,’ she said. In an interview with Woman & Home magazine, out on Thursday, she revealed her partner Alice Arnold, 52, had her reservations about the weight loss. ‘But when she saw me in it she thought I looked good. And I felt great,’ she added. Miss Balding’s glamorous new look makes a change from the jeans and loose-fitting blouses she is more often seen wearing to present programmes such as Channel 4’s racing coverage. Miss Balding back in 2012 before her health kick which sees her regularly exercise and diet, and right, on the cover of Woman & Home . And it highlights just how much her shape has changed in recent years, after a bet with her mother spurred on to get in shape. She had caught sight of herself looking ‘as if I’d been blown up with a bicycle pump’, she once said, on a TV monitor at the Newmarket races in 2013. Miss Balding was spurred to get in shape after a bet with her mother, offering £100 per pound of weight shed to whoever lost the most. She used a Jawbone fitness band to count her steps, which she said made ‘a massive difference to my life’. She walked 10,000 steps per day, monitored by a calorie-counting app, and went on a diet – although she has admitted not sticking to the 1,200 calorie limit. And the result was a 20lb weight loss in the space of two-and-a-half months. Tomorrow Miss Balding’s new entertainment and sport chat show begins on BBC2.

North Korean officials could not be reached for comment. Meanwhile, state media in the largely isolated communist country has not yet reported on the incident. Kazi Muhammad Ziauddin, a top official in Bangladesh's customs agency, told CNN his officers discovered the gold on the afternoon of March 5th, after the diplomat arrived on a Singapore Airlines flight. Ziauddin said customs officials had received a confidential tip that a North Korean diplomat would be carrying \"illegal items.\" \"It was very tough. We have to be very careful and sensitive when we deal with a diplomat,\" Ziauddin said, referring to the Vienna Convention, which affords diplomats certain degrees of consular immunity. He said the suspect, whom he identified as Son Young Nam, the first secretary of North Korea's embassy in Dhaka, initially refused to allow his baggage to be searched. \"He said there is no way we can open or scan his bag,\" Ziauddin said. \"At first he said 'This is an electric motor.'  After further questioning he changed his mind and told us, 'These are cipher machines and very confidential.'\" Eventually, customs officers opened the diplomat's bag and found the undeclared goods, that included 170 gold bars and golden ornaments. At current market prices, the gold would be valued at around $1 million. Entering Bangladesh without declaring this quantity of precious metal is a violation of the country's customs regulations. An official with Bangladesh's Foreign Secretary, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity, said his government lodged a protest with the North Korean ambassador. It's far too early to jump to conclusions about whether the alleged gold smuggling incident could be an isolated example of corruption or an effort to move official funds. Due to international sanctions, North Korea faces substantial obstacles when trying to access international banking systems. \"It would be interesting to see if [the diplomat] is disciplined when he gets back\" to North Korea, said John Delury, associate professor at Yonsei University's Graduate School of International Studies. \"That would be a way of saying whether or not he's a corrupt diplomat.\" According to the Foreign Secretary's office in Bangladesh, the North Korean diplomat allegedly caught carrying the gold has since left the country.

The male badger was found in an outdoor toilet in Beaminster in Dorset and was admitted to RSPCA West Hatch Wildlife Centre in Taunton, Somerset with wounds to its neck and rump. Experts believe the animal is likely to have been injured in a fight over its territory because females usually give birth in February and are ready to mate again straight away - leading to fierce competition between males. A rare albino badger was taken to a rescue centre after being found with deep bite wounds to its neck and rump, believed to have been caused by fighting over territory during the current mating season . RSPCA wildlife centre supervisor Paul Oaten said: 'Albino badgers are fairly rare so to have one admitted to the centre only happens once in a blue moon. 'This poor badger came in to us with territorial bite wounds on his neck and rump, but other than that he is in good condition. 'He has been seen by the vet and had the wounds cleaned up and will be undergoing a course of antibiotics.' Mr Oaten said it was common to see badgers with these type of wounds during the breeding season. The injured animal was rescued as dozens of badgers have been born in Somerset, in time for Spring.

While the rest of the English Super League clubs spend two or even three nights on their annual trips to the south of France, the Rhinos charter their own plane to get them in and out of the city on the day of the game. It is a move that has paid off so far, with Brian McDermott's men winning on each of their last three trips to the Stade Gilbert Brutus, and the coach believes it could be even more important this time with the hectic Easter programme coming up. Leeds Rhinos boss Brian McDermott set for clash with Catalan Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday . 'There's a lot of meticulous planning involved but it's something we prefer to do and it's a more efficient way of doing it,' McDermott said. 'Sometimes we don't treat our players as robustly as they should be treated, certainly in terms of travel. 'It's worked well for us. I don't think travelling on the day of the game is as detrimental as you would imagine, although I wouldn't do it every single weekend. 'What it does do is help you recover for the following game. The players get to spend the night before they travel in their own bed and on the night of the game they're back in their own bed again, albeit later than normal.' The Dragons have also chartered their own plane for trips to England but they spent last week in Manchester to take in back-to-back away games against the two Hull clubs. Brad Singleton of Leeds Rhinos scores his teams third try of the game against Wigan last week . That exercise can only be described as a failure after Laurent Frayssinous' men lost both games, conceding 83 points in the process, but McDermott expects them to be back to their formidable best back on French soil, where they are unbeaten so far this year. 'I am sure they will be good,' McDermott said. 'They'll be determined to turn things around. Every team has a tussle with them when they go out there.' Saturday's meeting between the clubs will be the first since the Catalans ended Leeds' play-off hopes with a dramatic 24-20 triumph at Headingley last September. Leeds are still without skipper Kevin Sinfield, as well as prop Kylie Leuluai and winger Tom Briscoe, so Liam Sutcliffe, Ash Handley and Andy Yates keep their places following the win over Wigan.

But it seems the first major hurdle facing the British comedian is whether some Americans even recognize him. A spoof video released by CBS ahead of his first appearance on The Late Late Show on Monday depicts the funnyman trying to get back into the studios - but a security guard refuses. The employee asks for Corden for an identification badge, but Corden is forced to explain he has just got back from lunch, while patting down his pockets. 'I can't let you in without a badge,' the guard adds. A frustrated Corden then starts arguing with the man, saying he is the host of the chat show and points to a huge poster of his face on the side of the building. The guard looks around, but he says: 'I don't see the resemblance'. 'What do you mean there is no resemblance?' Corden replies. 'It looks exactly the same as me. Do you know why? Because it is me' The employee then realizes who he is talking to, but insists Corden still needs a badge to get in.

Any accident raises questions, and the National Transportation Safety Board is sending people to New York's LaGuardia Airport to investigate. Although the cause of the crash is not yet clear, officials will no doubt be looking at the conditions on the runway. Was it cleared and ready? Did the pilot have all relevant information? CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo breaks down the responsibilities around runways. \"There are a couple of things that airports have to do,\" she said. \"The airport has to go out and measure whether the airport runways have friction, meaning when those tires touch down that they will have some contact with the runway.\" That information is then relayed to the air traffic control tower, according to Schiavo. \"As to whether the runways are slippery, that is breaking action, and the airport gets that from the reports of previous pilots,\" she said. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Patrick Foye told reporters that the runway in question had been plowed shortly before the incident. Pilots on previous planes reported \"good braking action,\" he said. Just minutes after the Delta plane landed, all of LaGuardia Arport shut down to air traffic. One runway reopened at 2 p.m. ET. The other remained closed. Miles O'Brien, another CNN aviation analyst, highlights how difficult it is to understand all the elements in play. \"The wind was changing. The temperatures were changing. It was moving from rain to freezing rain, ultimately into snow.

Detectives said it was too early to speculate on the motive behind the shooting - which happened at about 10.20pm local time (9.20pm GMT) - but there were indications that it was gang-related. Two dead and eight injured: The shooting took place inside a pub called ‘Var Krog och Bar’ (Our Tavern and Bar) in Biskopsgarden, a suburb of Gothenburg in Sweden, at about 10.20pm local time yesterday . Police spokesman Ulla Brehm said that at least two people were killed at the scene and several others taken to a hospital, adding: ‘There is absolutely nothing that indicates terrorism.’ One witness, who did not wish to be named, told Swedish broadcaster SVT that two men entered the pub and started shooting with automatic weapons. He said: ‘I didn't have a chance to think about what happened. Then I saw that my friend was bleeding. I tried to stop the bleeding as well as I could with my hand.’ Several people are now being questioned by police. Ms Brehm said the area on Hisingen, an island off Gothenburg, had seen a lot of gang violence and that was a likely explanation for the shooting.

She accused the standout driver of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against a wall in his motor home at Delaware's Dover International Speedway in September. Twice, the NASCAR 2004 Cup champion appealed his indefinite suspension and lost both times. That meant he missed the season-opening Daytona 500 as well as two subsequent Sprint Cup races. But he should be able to compete through the fall, and NASCAR says that it will waive its requirement for him to compete in all championship events. The case against Busch took a significant turn last week, when the Delaware Department of Justice announced that charges would not be filed against him. \"As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse,\" Busch said then. \"I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life.\" A Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February that Busch must stay away from Driscoll for a year. NASCAR officials decided to lift Busch's suspension because he complied with the requirements of the racing circuit's reinstatement program, completed behavioral assessments and got the OK from a behavioral health care expert to race again.

The work of architect Nikola Basic and expert Dalmatian stone carvers, the musical sea organ (morske orgulje) was created in 2005 and is the first of its kind in the world. Carved into the white stone, the aerophone is 70 meters long and contains a total of 35 organ pipes built under the concrete. The movement of the sea pushes air through each of the individual organ pipes via a plastic tube submerged in the water. And depending on the size and power of the wave, unique musical chords are played through each of the whistle openings on the quayside above. As the sea forces are unpredictable in terms of tidal power, the organ provides a never-ending composition that features numerous musical variations. The sea organ itself was built as part of a music project that looked to repair Zadar, which had suffered much damage during the Second World War. The musical sea organ is the work of architect Nikola Basic and expert Dalmatian stone carvers . The aerophone is 70 meters long and contains a total of 35 organ pipes, which are built under the concrete . It was opened to the public in April 2005 in a bid to redesign the new city coast by having the waves interact with the organ and thus with the people on the shore via the medium of music. The sea organ was awarded with the prize ex-aequo of the fourth edition of the European Prize for Urban Public Space in 2006. Zadar is the centre of its namesake county – a part of the wider northern Dalmatian region. Director Alfred Hitchcock is believed to have said that Zadar has the most beautiful sunset in the world, which can be seen from the exact spot of where the organ is today. In 2006 the sea organ was awarded with the prize ex-aequo of the fourth edition of the European Prize for Urban Public Space .", "completion": "response:\n\nThe sea organ is the work of famous Croatian architect Nikola Basic .\nContaining a total of 35 organ pipes, the aerophone is 70 meters long .\nSea movement pushes air through each individual organ pipe via a tube .\nThe music is played through whistle openings on the quayside above ."}

Tom Brokaw has announced he will share the story about his battle with cancer in a new memoir titled A Lucky Life Interrupted. Brokaw, 75, drew upon a journal he began keeping in late 2013 after he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer in the bone marrow's white blood cells. The retired NBC anchor said he hopes the book will help others who have to deal 'with this unwelcome condition,' in a statement he released through publisher Random House. The book will be released May 12. Brokaw remained private through much of his cancer treatment, publicly announcing he had cancer only six months after he was diagnosed. During an interview with David Letterman, Brokaw said he was 'pleased with the progress' of his treatment but that's as far as he would go in describing his fight with the disease. 'There are a lot of other people out there...going through what I'm going through, and they don't have the advantages I do,' he told the talk show host, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Brokaw, who told Letterman his work was 'therapy', continued to work throughout his treatment, serving as a special NBC correspondent and contributing to the network's winter Olympics coverage in Sochi last year. In September Brokaw revealed on the Today Show that the cancer was almost gone, although he recognized that 'the disease will not completely go away' but can be 'managed'. Three months later Brokaw announced that he was officially in remission and that he would be going on a drug maintenance regimen 'to keep it there', he said in a note to his 'NBC family' that was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. Brokaw served as the head anchor for NBC Nightly News for 23 years before he retired and passed the chair to Brian Williams in 2004. He remained mostly silent during the controversy surrounding Williams' story about his experience in the Iraq war and released a statement that said the anchor's fate was in both Williams and NBC's hands. Brokaw continues to serve as a special correspondent for NBC and has written seven other books. Brokaw, who was the lead anchor of NBC Nightly News for 23 years and still serves as a network correspondent, said he hoped the book would help others who had to deal 'with this unwelcome condition'", "completion": "response:\n\nThe book will be titled A Lucky Life Interrupted and will be released May 12 .\nBrokaw drew upon a journal he began keeping after he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2013 .\nThe former NBC news anchor remained fairly private throughout his treatment .\nAnnounced he was in remission in December 2014 ."}

Sportsmail can reveal that Pietersen has told Surrey, who released him at the end of last summer, that he will not play all county cricket for them next season — even though he was urged to do so when offered a lifeline by new ECB chairman Colin Graves. He appeared to call Pietersen’s bluff by saying the 34-year-old would be considered for an England recall if he threw his lot in with a county and stated his case by scoring heavily in domestic cricket. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Yet it seems unlikely the county will be Surrey, who have not been able to reach agreement with Pietersen over a deal to play in red-ball cricket as well as the white-ball game. The fact Pietersen struggled to attract a contract in this year’s Indian Premier League, before Sunrisers Hyderabad signed him in a cut-price deal, seemed to suggest the path may be clear for a return to domestic cricket. But unless Pietersen is prepared to move away from London — something he previously stated he would not do — it seems that his options are diminishing. Leicestershire may take on Pietersen but it remains to be seen if he will deign to play in the second division. A return for Pietersen in England colours (above) is now looking more and more unlikely . Somerset, coached by Pietersen’s friend Matt Maynard, remain an option but the odds are against him being given a platform to stake a claim for England. Graves, who does not succeed Giles Clarke as chairman until May 15, appeared to go against the wishes of senior figures in the England set-up when he seemed to endorse a Pietersen recall.

The beasts find them a miserable and stressful experience, research reveals. As a herd animal, horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours, according to a study by Nottingham Trent University. Stable condition: Scientists found the animals’ stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated . Scientists found animals that were isolated had higher levels of stress hormones and became difficult to manage. The findings, published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour, showed that horses are at their happiest in a paddock. Scientists found the animals’ stress levels - measured by the hormone corticosterone - rose and they became difficult to manage as they became increasingly isolated. These stress levels could also lead to sickness and disease, the study published in the journal Physiology and Behaviour found. Research: The study by Nottingham Trent University (above) found that as a herd animal, horses prefer to be in groups and stables prevent them interacting with their neighbours . Equine welfare expert Kelly Yarnell told the Daily Telegraph: ‘To the human eye, the stable appears safe and inviting and is based on the belief of what the horse finds comfortable. ‘However, for a social animal that spends most of its time in close contact with other horses, the isolation brought about by single housing could activate an equine stress response.’ She said equine welfare would be improved by shared housing. In the wild, horses live in herds that move over up to 30 sq miles while domestic horses often spend most of the day inside. Lee Hackett, director of equine policy at The British Horse Society, said the study should change the way we keep horses. He said: ‘It is fairly obvious that keeping any animal in a domestic setting could potentially compromise it, whether that be a hamster in a cage or a lion in a zoo.'", "completion": "response:\n\nStables prevent horses interacting with their neighbours, scientists say .\nIsolated animals suffer higher stress levels and become harder to manage .\nNottingham Trent University study shows horses are happiest in paddock ."}

In the footage he says: 'I didn't want the commercial to have lots of special effects and my hair look \"duang!\" - suddenly blacker and shinier.' People's Daily report that the footage was recorded in 2004 but recently reappeared online, sparking an online frenzy over the sound.

Although many people are using the word to mock the actor, who is seen as a pro-Beijing political figure by many in China, Chan has been a good sport about it all.

And speaking about it at the studio of Hidden Energy, a Chinese reality TV show where he appears as a judge, he said: 'When I came here this morning, everyone was saying \"duang duang\". I’m confused myself.' While Chan is all smiles about the commercial now, it was a different story after the advert aired in 2004. Authorities ruled that the commercial made false claims, and Chan's reputation suffered. But now parodies of Chan's shampoo endorsement are spreading online.

Explaining his idea at the start of the video, the dad says: ‘I was always curious what JJ saw when we threw him in the air. ‘So we are going to put the GoPro on the baby and throw him in the air, and then I’m going to let him see my side.’ The dad gets the experiment underway after counting down from three and the youngster begins laughing in excitement. The camera picks up the sense of speed as the baby is propelled from the father’s arms before stopping in the air and returning to him safely. After explaining his idea to the camera the dad prepares to throw his son into the air by counting down from three . Up, up and away! The baby's perspective captures the snowy garden, the dog and his dad awaiting his return . Catching a view of the whole garden, the camera picks up the surrounding snow, the shadows from the tree, the dog looking upwards curiously and the father awaiting his son’s landing.

The 35-year-old suspect, who was described as an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh, died from severe injuries before officers could rescue him, said L.L. Doungal, a police official in the remote Nagaland state, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. \"There were thousands of them. Many of them were students in uniform,\" Doungal said, referring to the mobs involved in the incident. The suspect was accused of raping a local  woman last month. Since the attack,  tensions have grown between the native Nagas and Bangladeshi migrants in the district, police said. Thousands of protesters demanding cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex  Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said. Police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man, but it didn't work, he said. \"There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,\" Doungal added. Later, police opened fire, but it was too late to save the suspect. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack,  according to authorities. \"We retrieved his body before it could be hung,\" Doungal said. Dimapur town has been placed under a curfew. \"The situation is still volatile,\" he said. India made international headlines this month when it banned a documentary  showing an interview with a convicted rapist, who blamed his victim and said she \"should just be silent and allow the rape.\" Outrage has grown following the incident, which gives a window into the violence against women in the nation. The woman in the documentary incident was attacked by five men on a public bus in 2012. She later died from her injuries, sparking an outcry worldwide.

Hazlewood, replacing seamer Pat Cummins, combined with left-armer Mitchell Starc to remove Pakistan's openers cheaply and returned to punch a hole through the Asian team's middle-order on a sun-drenched autumn day. Part-time spinner Glenn Maxwell took two wickets and Aaron Finch three catches at deep midwicket, as captain Misbah-ul-Haq and two other Pakistan right-handers gave up their wickets on a platter when attempting to clear the short boundary. Misbah won the toss and opted to bat first but the move backfired with openers Sarfraz Ahmed and Ahmed Shehzad both out within three balls before the sixth over. Sarfraz, on 10, edged a quicker ball from Starc to Shane Watson who took a fine, low catch diving to his right in the slips. Hazlewood (4-35) then struck to remove Shehzad for five, the opener edging behind to Australia captain Michael Clarke. Misbah was nearly out for a duck two balls later when the ball brushed his stump after clipping his thigh pad, but the bails stayed intact. He and number three batsman Haris Sohail battled to steady the innings and the Pakistan skipper smashed Maxwell over the fence twice. But Maxwell had the last laugh, breaking the 73-run partnership when Misbah miscued a slog-sweep straight to Finch in the 24th over. The writing was on the wall when Mitchell Johnson had Sohail out for 41 soon after, following up a venomous bouncer with a wide, fuller delivery to the left-hander who sent a leaden-footed edge to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. Infuriatingly for Pakistan fans, Umar Akmal (20) and Shahid Afridi (23) repeated their captain's horrid dismissal, holing out to Finch on the rope off the bowling of Maxwell and Hazlewood respectively. That left Pakistan reeling at 158-6, but paceman Wahab Riaz added 30 runs with Sohaib Maqsood before the middle order batsman slashed Hazlewood straight to Johnson at cover to be out for 29. Wahab was out a few balls later for 16, nicking Starc behind to Haddin, before Sohail Khan sent a top-edge from a Hazlewood ball soaring high into the sky before landing in the wicketkeeper's gloves.

A serial thief who admitted committing more than 200 burglaries in just two years has avoided jail and been ordered to attend a ‘victim empathy course’, it was revealed today. Tomas Drungelas, 33, of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was spared a prison sentence - despite victims telling the judge that they would ‘be angry’ if he was treated leniently. The Lithuanian criminal broke into and burgled 202 homes in the Hertfordshire area between 2013 and 2014 to fund his addiction to alcohol and gambling, St Albans Crown Court was told. But Judge Andrew Bright QC said that he would spare Drungelas jail and send him on a locally-run rehabilitation course called Choices and Consequences, or the ‘C2 Programme’. He also said Drungelas would be tagged for 36 months, under curfew between 9pm and 6am and must complete 200 hours of unpaid work. Drungelas was also ordered to go on the victim empathy course as well as attend alcohol and gambling ‘intervention programmes’. The judge said: ‘The victims of some of the burglaries you have committed have contacted me and expressed their anger if you were to be treated leniently. ‘Under normal circumstances you would face five or six years in prison for the offences you have committed, and many people will say that this is not the way to deal with a prolific burglar. 'However, you have been given an opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to turning your life around.' He added: ‘Some may say that this is a let off, but it is not, because if you break any of the conditions or reoffend you will find yourself back in this court and you will serve the full sentence for the crimes you have admitted to, which could be five or six years in prison.’ The C2 Programme is run by Hertfordshire Constabulary in partnership with the probation service, ‘under the direction’ of Judge Bright. It aims to turn around the lives of ‘prolific offenders’ to offer them a ‘realistic opportunity to break free from the cycle of crime’. In its first year 31 criminals took part, confessing to 1,800 crimes.

Board chairman and chief executive Brian Cornell, who joined the company last August, detailed how the restructuring program will 'transform the retailer's business'. He said: 'Following a thorough, strategic review of our business, coupled with a careful evaluation of the changing retail landscape, we have identified the key initiatives that will put Target on a clear path to growth. 'We're focused on our future and building the capabilities that will take us further, faster. 'Redefining Target will require a renewed emphasis on prioritization and innovation, and above all else, putting our guests first in everything we do.'

The Bolton boxer had hoped to take on Floyd Mayweather but the pound-for-pound king will instead meet Manny Pacquaio in a $300million mega-fight on May 2. And now it seems Khan has set his sights on facing the man dubbed by many as the new Mayweather. Amir Khan (left) says he'd love to fight Adrien Broner after the American said he'd be ready this month . Broner, a former three weight world champion, won a unanimous points decision over John Molina on Saturday as he continued to rebuild his reputation after losing his undefeated record two years ago to Marcos Maidana – who then twice fought and lost to Mayweather. So comfortable was the Molina fight for Broner that on Tuesday he said he would be ready to face Khan 'at the end of this month'. Writing on Instagram, Broner said: 'No disrespect to Virgil Hunter he is a great coach and I got endless love for him but me and Amir Khan can fight at the end of this month I haven't taken any punishment I'm back in the gym and ready to make a fool out of anybody #AboutBillions #ABonNBC' Khan appeared to laugh off Broner's claims on Twitter before going on to tweet: 'Would love to fight @AdrienBroner next! #KhanvsBroner lets make it happen.' Broner won a unanimous points decision on Saturday but says he copped little punishment and is in the gym . On Monday, Broner even suggested he would be prepared to come to England to fight Khan. 'I can't wait. I'd even fight him at Wembley,' Broner told BoxingNews24. Last year Mayweather hit back at Khan's claims he was running scared and told him to prove his credentials by beating Broner on the undercard of his first fight with Maidana. Floyd Mayweather hit back at Khan's claims he was running scared but chose to fight Manny Pacquaio .

The bird was found dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin after being tied up with nylon bailing twine for days. Nicholas Wells, 37, of Bedworth, had pleaded not guilty, blaming a burglar for the offence - which was discovered by RSPCA inspector Louise Labram last June - but was found guilty after an eight-hour trial. A man who tied a cockerel to a trap and used it as live bait to lure foxes has been convicted of cruelty. The bird was found dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin from being tied up . He appeared in court in Birmingham to face charges against the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 and the Animal Cruelty Act 2006. Recalling how she found the bird and came to its rescue, Ms Labram said: 'I found the cockerel in such a critical state that it wasn't able to stand. 'The bird was horrifyingly dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin from being tied up with nylon bailing twine for some days. 'I was just sickened to see the cockerel stuck desperately in a barbaric situation like this - completely vulnerable, defenceless, and in alien surroundings, just lying there waiting to die either slowly from dehydration or by being eaten by the fox that this trap was clearly set for.' Nicholas Wells, 37, of Bedworth, had pleaded not guilty, blaming a burglar for the offence - which was discovered by an RSPCA inspector last June - but was found guilty after an eight-hour trial in Birmingham . Wells admitted owning the trap but said that normally he would use eggs, cat food and dead chickens to catch foxes roaming around the area. He claimed that a burglar had brought the bantam cockerel and had placed it in the trap - but his argument was thrown out by the district judge. The court was told that the cockerel 'was very lucky to have pulled through from a terrible act of cruelty.' The bird had survived the ordeal and, according to the RSPCA inspector, 'is now living the happy, healthy life that he deserves.' Wells was found guilty of using a live bird as a decoy for the purpose of killing or taking a wild animal and causing unnecessary suffering to ananimal. He was fined £750 for each offence and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £75 and a contribution towards costs of £2,300.", "completion": "response:\n\nBird found dehydrated, emaciated and bruised all the way down to its skin .\nIt had been tied up with nylon bailing twine for  number of days, court heard .\nNicholas Wells, 37, had pleaded not guilty, blaming burglar for the offence .\nBut he was found guilty after an eight-hour trial in Birmingham ."}

Having excitable young bears in tow, though, makes things a little trickier. He said: 'It's a fascinating scene to watch unfold. 'Polar bears live in a world of extremes, and yet despite their fearsome reputation show a remarkably touching side. 'They are programmed to survive like no other animal on earth, and the sheer enormity of the tasks these mothers have to take on every couple of years is beyond belief. 'I have the utmost respect for all animals that can make a living in the Arctic, and bears top the lot.' Content: The family of bears was spotted in the Waspusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada .

The footage captured on the skydiver’s head camera begins with a trio jumping from a plane over Perris, California. Initially the jump appears to be a success as the skydiver picks up images of the plane, his fellow skydivers dressed in wingsuits and the Californian landscape on his camera. So far so good: The skydiver captures his fellow jumpers on their descent over Perris, California . But suddenly, the bridle, which connects the pilot chute – a small auxiliary parachute used to deploy the main parachute – to the deployment bag containing the parachute, wraps around the pilot chute. It then appears that the reserve parachute, which is automatically deployed via an RSL (reserve static line) system after cutting away from the main parachute, becomes tangled. This sends the skydiver spiralling out of control, and he begins a dizzying descent back down to earth from a height of more than 1000ft. The skydiver's reserve parachute, which is automatically deployed via an RSL system after cutting away from the main parachute, becomes tangled . The skydiver is sent spiralling out of control and back down to earth at a height of more than 1000ft . As he finally reaches the ground it appears that he is descending relatively slowly considering he is without a fully working parachute. But as he slams into the earth with a crunch he groans in pain and shock before attempting to rise to his feet. The man was later taken to the hospital where, remarkably, he was only treated for mild concussion and bruising.

Is it OK for a patient to choose to spend his or her final days on this mortal coil in what would amount to a medically induced coma? Or is it simply euthanasia in disguise? Members of the French Parliament offered resounding support Tuesday for the proposition that is should be permissible for doctors to induce sleep until death in terminally ill patients who are in pain. They approved a bill allowing that by a vote of 436-34. There were, however, 83 lawmakers who declined to vote -- a measure of just how contentious the issue has been. The bill goes now to the French Senate. Should it become law, doctors would be allowed to administer \"deep sedation until death\" to terminally ill patients who request it, and for whom palliative care would not ease the pain. The law would also allow doctors who have stopped life-saving measures to administer deep sedation, if they deem it appropriate, to terminally ill patients who are unable to give their consent. \"Everyone has the right to a death that is dignified and soothed,\" the proposed law says. And health professionals, it continues, should \"implement all the means at their disposal to fulfill this right.\" What the law entails, according to Jean Leonetti, the member of Parliament who proposed it, is simple: \"Sleep before death to avoid suffering.\" What it also entails is legal protection for doctors who, in fact, already sedate some dying patients, and who are sometimes taken to court by relatives as a result. Euthanasia is illegal in France, though President Francois Hollande promised in his 2012 campaign that he would reopen the issue. Polls show that more than 90% of French people support the proposal -- an astonishing majority for any proposal -- and Hollande has said it  would represent a big step forward. But, as might be predicted, the proposed law has proved divisive in the extreme. Some lawmakers on the left of the political spectrum said in advance they would abstain from Tuesday's vote because they thought the bill did not go far enough toward legalizing euthanasia. And some on the right said they, too, would abstain, because they saw the law is a way of legalizing euthanasia in disguise.

Last week, the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said the £145.50-a-year charge was ‘anachronistic’ and should be scrapped within the next decade in favour of a flat-rate broadcast levy on all households. But Lord Hall, the Corporation’s director-general, insisted yesterday that the licence fee ‘has got at least another ten years in it’, adding: ‘I think it could go well beyond that.’ Not dead yet: BBC Director-general Lord Tony Hall has said he believes the licence fee ‘has got at least another ten years in it’ Even if the fee is axed, he said it should be replaced by an equivalent charge.

Yesterday, Lord Hall backed the proposal, but said it was simply ‘another way of the licence fee being modernised’. But he also warned that the BBC risks ‘sleepwalking into decay’ unless it reinvents itself for the internet age by collecting users’ data. Lord Hall said the Corporation is in danger of becoming ‘irrelevant’ if it does not gather information about viewers to tailor its services, in a similar way to Amazon and Netflix.

That has angered Hughes, his former Manchester United team-mate. ‘Steve has fallen into the trap of trying to defend the indefensible,’ said Hughes. ‘Everyone has seen the two challenges and I don't think there is any sort of comparison whatsoever. ‘The outcome is there for everyone to see so I don't think Steve did himself too much credit with his observation. ‘It's fairly easily to defend things - and I do it too - but on this occasion it was not as if the lad would be suspended. So why did Steve not just say, “It was a terrible tackle”? 'We're trying to move on but Steve did not need to do that. He did not need to say that. To defend that is incorrect.’ Stoke boss Mark Hughes has accused Hull City counterpart Steve Bruce of trying to 'defend the indefensible' Hull boss Bruce queried why Stephen Ireland was on the pitch after his challenge on David Meyler . Hughes added: ‘It looks likely Stephen is unavailable for two to three weeks. ‘Most people now have seen the picture and he’s had internal stitches as well as external, so it takes a little bit longer than a straightforward gash. ‘I’m disappointed as he was doing really well, filling the gap for Bojan.’", "completion": "response:\n\nStephen Ireland forced off after Maynor Figueroa tackle on Saturday .\nHull City defender scraped studs down back of Ireland's calf in defeat .\nSteve Bruce claims Ireland should have been sent off earlier in the game .\nMark Hughes angered by Bruce and says he should accept Figueroa's error .\nStoke City boss says Hull counterpart is trying to 'defend the indefensible'"}

The group of 11 people includes seven Britons, an American, a Canadian and two Sudanese, Mehmet Ali Ediboglu said. Ediboglu, an opposition Turkish lawmaker, told The Observer that he had spoken with the students' families, who were convinced their loved ones wanted to work for ISIS and were asking him for help tracking them down in neighboring Syria. \"They have been cheated, brainwashed. That is what I, and their relatives, think,\" Ediboglu said, according to the newspaper. But he also stressed that the group did not travel with the intention of joining the battle. \"Let's not forget about the fact that they are doctors,\" he told The Observer. \"They went there to help, not to fight.\" Eight of the group are medical students who've just graduated and three others are in their final year of medical school, he said. They'd been studying in Khartoum, Sudan. Now, at least seven of their mothers and fathers are living near the Turkey-Syria border, pleading for their return, according to The Observer. In an interview published Monday in Turkey's Hürriyet Daily News, the group of parents said they were worried and vowed not to leave Turkey without their children. Dr. Maumoon Abdulqadir said he was sending a message to his daughter, Lena, who is one of the students. \"I know you want to help people and be of use. But you can do this in another way,\" he told the newspaper. \"There are many who need your help. But this is not the way. Please, come back.\" British officials said they are aware of the report. \"We are providing consular assistance to their families and we have informed the Turkish police to try and ascertain their whereabouts,\" the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office said in a statement. Officials have warned that a growing number of foreign fighters are traveling to join ISIS' ranks. Estimates about how many medical personnel the group has recruited are harder to come by. Last year, a 19-year-old Colorado woman was arrested at Denver International Airport as she was about to embark on a journey to an ISIS camp, where she hoped to serve as a nurse.

Parking charges at a popular British seaside resort could soon be weather dependent after a council pledged to halve them when it rains. Councillors in Brighton and Hove say they want to end 'rip-off' charges and are suggesting motorists pay 'significantly less' for street parking on rainy summer days. The scheme, which would be the first of its kind in the UK, is modeled on flexible parking charges schemes in San Francisco and Madrid. It forms part of the Conservative Party manifesto for the May 7 council elections promising, 'A common sense council for Brighton and Hove'. It says: 'We will examine flexible parking charges and the innovative use of technology e.g. introduce significantly cheaper charges in winter, on rainy summer days etc. 'It is bizarre that summer parking rates begin on 1 March.Under the Conservatives summer parking charges will only apply in summer.' But critics have hailed it as an early April Fools' Day joke, given the fickle British summertime weather. Conservative transport spokesman Graham Cox, told The Telegraph the economy relied on the weather and they had to look at ways of attracting people when it was bad. 'If it's a lovely, hot, summer day in June, July or August, the queues in Brighton will stretch up the A23 and every space in town is taken. If it's wet, it's a very different situation,' he said. Every cloud: Conservative councillors in Brighton and Hove are promising to halve the cost of parking on rainy days in summer in a bid to boost tourist numbers . In 2013, business leaders blamed parking charges and poor weather for the plummeting number of visitors to the region during a particularly wet summer. Figures from the Brighton Business Improvement District (BID) showed footfall in the city had dropped by 14 per cent year-on-year. Costly sunshine: Visitors would be charged twice as much to park on sunny days under new proposals by councillors in Brighton . The parking proposal would be based on weather forecasts so if heavy downpours were predicted for a particular weekend, the parking tariffs would be reduced. Motoring organisations said it would confuse drivers and said both tariffs and clear instructions would need putting on street parking signs.", "completion": "response:\n\n'Significantly cheaper' charges promised during rainy summer days .\nThe cut rate aims to boost falling visitor numbers to resort when its wet .\nCritics call it an early April Fools' Day prank that will confuse motorists ."}

But he will be suiting up in Philadelphia as a vital cog in Chip Kelly's offense. The NFL's Offensive Player of the Year is set to sign a five-year deal worth more than $40million, with more than $20m guaranteed, according to NFL.com's Albert Breer. Murray became the NFL's leading rusher thanks to a career-high number of carries (392) and working behind one of the best offensive lines in football. DeMarco Murray is set to join the Philadelphia Eagles after four seasons with the Cowboys . In a career-high year, Murray carried the Cowboys into the playoffs for the first time in five years . With rumours that veteran Evan Mathis is to be traded, the Eagles do have the youth or consistency in that position group.

We all find noise annoying – but if it really bothers you it could be because you're a genius. Being overly sensitive to sound could have been the key to the creativity of geniuses like Charles Darwin and Franz Kafka – who both complained of their difficulty of filtering out noise – research has revealed. Psychologists now believe that an inability to shut out irrelevant sensory information could be strongly linked to creativity. French writer Marcel Proust was famous for wearing earplugs and lining his bedroom with cork to block out the outside sound while he worked. And Kafka once said 'I need solitude for my writing; not \"like a hermit\" - that wouldn't be enough - but like a dead man.' Darwin and write Anton Chekhov were also known to have complained about how they found it difficult to filter out noise. Scientists at Northwestern University, Illinois, tested 100 people on their ability to find original solutions to problems and found strong links between an inability to shut out irrelevant audio stimuli, dubbed 'leaky' sensory gating, and creativity. In tests 100 people were provided solutions to scenarios, with the challenge of coming up with as many original answers as possible. This was designed to measure their level of 'real world creative achievement'. The findings, published in the journal Neuropsychologia, suggest those with the affliction might find it easier to think creatively as they can focus on a wide range of things simultaneously. Darya Zabelina, a PhD psychology student at Northwestern University in Illinois said: 'If funnelled in the right direction, these sensitivities can make life more rich and meaningful, giving experiences more subtlety.'", "completion": "response:\n\nInability to shut out irrelevant sounds could be linked to creativity .\nBeing overly sensitive to sounds could be key to genius, scientists say .\nCharles Darwin among great minds who complained about too much noise ."}

Mick Schumacher was racing through the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, when he skidded out of control and onto the gravel, it was reported. The young protege began karting seven years ago, and this year reached the German Formula 4 - a racing category used as a stepping stone by junior drivers. Mick Schumacher (pictured), 15, crashed while testing a Formula 4 car on a race track in east Germany . Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season (pictured) but this year has begun practicing for his first year in the Formula 4 .

His father, who remains recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races. Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4, a series for young talents, earlier this month. At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September.

A car dealer got into a row with his wife when he promised to take her out for a meal if she went to a football match with him - then drove her to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. Richard Burbage, 41, of Whiteley, Hampshire, then tried to fight an expert in martial arts who attempted to break up the argument. The father-of-three was convicted of assault and fined £320 for attacking Julian Raffle. Burbage had been arguing with his wife, Lorraine, in KFC after they had been to a football match on a Sunday afternoon. The row erupted because Burbage told his wife he would take her out for a meal in exchange for coming to the match with him. But when she discovered the meal meant being taken to KFC in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing. Dan O’Neill, prosecuting, told magistrates that customers at the eatery became disturbed by the row. He added that customer Mr Raffle then tried to calm the couple down and intervened. Mr O’Neil said there was then a struggle between Mr Raffle and Burbage - and the  car dealer twice tried to punch him. But what he did not realise was that Mr Raffle is an expert in the martial art of jiu-jitsu and when Burbage tried to upper cut Mr Raffle, he used his self-defence training to dodge the blows. When the wife discovered she was going to KFC (above) in Hedge End, Hampshire, the couple began arguing . Burbage was then arrested and charged with common assault. After admitting this at Southampton Magistrates’ Court, he was fined £200. He also had to pay £100 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. A separate allegation of assaulting his wife by beating on November 30 was dismissed after the prosecution offered no evidence. Mark Rigby, defending Burbage, said: ‘He and his wife both describe the relationship as feisty, fiery and passionate. ‘What he did was wrong because he swings for him and he bites off more than he can chew because Mr Raffle is trained in jiu-jitsu. ‘With hindsight they are very embarrassed by what sparked this. She was thinking she would be rewarded with a meal and wasn’t pleased to find out that that meal would be at KFC. ‘I think the salient lesson has been learned by the defendant and his wife.’", "completion": "response:\n\nRichard Burbage, 41, tried to fight  martial arts expert who intervened .\nHad been arguing with wife Lorraine after they attended football match .\nFather-of-three convicted of assault and fined for attacking Julian Raffle ."}

Other posters said \"family restrooms\" would take care of the problem altogether. Do modern dads get enough credit? Many praised Kutcher for raising the issue: \"Thank you for doing this. This is not just an issue for dad's such as yourself who are awesome, but so many of the families I know who have two daddies have this issue ALL The time,\" wrote one poster.

Saad al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs from the cash-strapped Rafah zoo. He has plans to raise them at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, although he faces a difficult task as the lions - and their appetites - grow. Saad al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms as one of them struggles in an effort to get back on the ground . Mr al-Jamal plans to raise the cubs at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip . He refused to say how much he paid for the cubs, but admitted to AFP that he has received a $9,000 offer (£6,000) to buy them. The two lion cubs, one male and one female, have been named Alex and Mona. They have been living in the three-bedroom flat ‘like members of the family’ for 10 weeks, and they play 'all day long' with Mr al-Jamal's children and grandchildren. Footage shows the cubs play-fighting on the floor of the family's flat, and interacting with young children. The lion cubs can be seen on the video interacting with Mr al-Jamal’s children and grandchildren . Bringing the cubs outside, Mr al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms and as of them fights against him to be put back down. Other clips show the owner is featured stroking them as they bask in the sun. It is believed that the parents of the cubs were brought into Gaza via a tunnel along the border with Egypt around three years ago. Raising two lion cubs is a costly venture, and Mr al-Jamal has plans to use them to earn money. He intends to lease them to parks, restaurants and seaside resorts once they are a few months older. Saad Al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs called Alex and Mona from the Rafah zoo . Once the cubs are 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and possess the ability to tear flesh . At just two months, the cubs eat half a kilogram of meat a day, and their appetites will become even larger as they get older. Right now the animals are at an age where they are unable to inflict any real damage. But once the cubs reach 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and will possess the ability to tear flesh.

But Burnley would receive about £6million in compensation if Ings joined another club in England, while a move abroad would net the second-bottom  side just £300,000. It would cost £43m for United to make Radamel Falcao's season-long loan from Monaco permanent, and Ings is a cut-price option. The starlet was reluctant to leave Burnley in January but becomes a free agent after May. Manchester City contacted his representatives in February and want to sign Ings to boost their homegrown quota. The  champions bought Wilfried Bony from Swansea City for £25m, rising to £28m, in January but Juventus have shown interest in Stevan Jovetic, while Edin Dzeko could leave for Wolfsburg.

Hair-rising fact: A quarter of the 800 million men in China are getting bald or are already bald, expert says . The new survey, which interviewed 5,779 men from five Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou revealed that 25 per cent of men are losing their hair.

At 29, the six-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro is among a number of new additions as the Jets look to break their four-year spell without a play-off place. Darrelle Revis defends Jeremy Kerley in the Patriot's narrow 17-16 win over the Jets in December . Revis lasted a year with the Buccaneers after penning a six-year, $96m deal with no guaranteed money. The Patriots moved swiftly following his release last year, with the parties agreeing on a $32m two-year deal. Owner Robert Kraft declined to take up the $20m second-year option, opting to re-sign safety Devin McCourty on big money instead. The deal appears a questionable one for the Super Bowl-winning Patriots. Revis and the recently released Brandon Browner gave them a secondary that was the envy of the AFC. But they lose a locker room leader  to an AFC East rival and Bill Belichick has to rebuild his secondary once more.

Scientists discovered that patients who listened to experts of Mozart had enhanced gene activity in the brain in areas including memory and learning. Meanwhile, the music also affected the activity of a risk gene connected to Parkinson's disease. Classical music can help slow down the onset of dementia by enhancing gene activity in the brain, new research has found . The Finnish researchers found the changed activity was only present in 'musically-experienced' patients, who listened to music regularly, suggesting the importance of familiarity with music. For the study, participants were asked to listen to Mozart's violin concert No 3, G-major, K.216, a piece that lasts 20 minutes. The experiment was carried out on both musically experienced and inexperienced participants. The research involved participants listening to Mozart (pictured) for 20 minutes . The study showed that genes were enhanced in those deemed 'musically experienced' in areas such as dopamine secretion, which is when a neurohormone is released in the brain, synaptic neurotransmission, which is how neurons receive information, and learning and memory. Meanwhile, the music appeared to down-regulate genes associated with neuro-degeneration, which is the progressive loss of the structure or function of neurons. The researchers said several of the up-regulated genes were ones which are responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds. This suggests a common evolutionary background of sound perception across different species, they said. One of the most affected genes in this area was synuclein-alpha (SNCA), which is also a known risk gene for Parkinson's disease. Study leader Doctor Irma Jarvela, of Helsinki University, said: 'The up-regulation of several genes that are known to be responsible for song learning and singing in songbirds suggest a shared evolutionary background of sound perception between vocalizing birds and humans.' He added: 'The effect was only detectable in musically experienced participants, suggesting the importance of familiarity and experience in mediating music-induced effects.' Dr Jarvela added that the findingscould give give further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying music therapy. The effects of this are still largely unknown.", "completion": "response:\n\nResearch saw patients listen to Mozart's violin concert No 3 for 20 minutes .\nThe 'musically-experienced' people had enhanced gene activity, it found .\nMusic also affected risk gene synuclein-alpha, connected to Parkinson's ."}

A greedy thief used empty KitKat wrappers to smuggle £20,000 out of his workplace. Peter Mills, 68, would eat the chocolate then fill the empty wrapper with wads of £50 notes that he stole from his employers Vaultex Ltd in Tonbridge, Kent. He was caught on CCTV after his employers at the cash handling depot became suspicious. They discovered 97 incidents over 50 days of Mills hiding the money then concealing the wrappers on his body. Suspicious staff searched him and found five £50 notes round a KitKat wrapper, famed for its slogan 'have a break, have a KitKat'. Kent Police was called and further cash was found in Mills's car. And when his locker was searched, police discovered a stash of empty KitKat wrappers inside. Mills from Chatham, Kent, initially denied stealing the money during interviews with police, claiming  the money must have got caught up in the sweet wrappers by accident. But he admitted four offences of theft at Maidstone Crown Court after bank statements revealed £30,000 in cash had been paid in over a four-month period from February to May 2014.

And the company already gives a nod to the marijuana culture with flavor names such as \"Half Baked.\" Marijuana is becoming more mainstream, too. Four states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana, and attitudes nationwide have been changing in favor of pot, which remains banned by federal law.

Students are seeking changes to an education bill that they say limits academic freedom and have been in negotiations with authorities, but these have been curbed because of the crackdown. The violence Tuesday occurred in Letpadan, a town of about 145 kilometers (90 miles) north of Yangon, the nation's largest city. The students' march began in Mandalay, about 640 kilometers (400 miles) north of Yangon. Zarni said the students had been \"given the red light\" on proceeding to Yangon. \"They had decided they would drive into the city, meet with other students there for 15 minutes of talks and then disperse,\" Zarni said. \"But within about an hour of being given this information, they were told that wasn't the case.\" \"Some students decided they would try, thinking the police would just take them away, but the police were so brutal.\" Police arrested about 40 to 50 people, according to Zarni. \"They broke a reporter's camera and cheered about it. They hit women. They hit monks who were also there. They went into the monastery and detained everyone who had run to hide in there,\" Zarni said. Human rights issues have been at the forefront in Myanmar, also known as Burma, as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian military rule, with elections planned for late this year. \"The public and we are losing confidence in the democratic transitions,\" Zarni said. Khin Lay, director of the Triangle Women Support Group, agreed. \"Students, human rights, women's rights -- we're all extremely angry about the way we have been treated over the years,\" said Lay. \"But we've been waiting for the 2015 elections with patience because we believe in the democracy movement, and we're hoping that we have the opportunity to exercise our right to vote.

'We know they are frequently stumbling across porn, often unintentionally, and they are telling us very clearly that this is having a damaging and upsetting effect on them. 'Girls in particular have said they feel like they have to look and behave like porn stars to be liked by boys. 'We absolutely have to talk to young people about sex, love, respect and consent as soon as we feel they are ready, to ensure that they gain a proper perspective between real life relationships and the fantasy world of porn.' Peter Liver, director of ChildLine, said children reported that watching porn made them feel depressed, gave them body image issues and put pressure on them to engage in sex acts they are not ready for. A report by charity ChildWise in 2013/14 revealed that website Pornhub was among the top five favourite sites named by boys aged 11-16. Dame Esther Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, said children as young as 11 had contacted the service with concerns about pornography . And young people post approximately 18,000 messages regarding exposure to porn on the ChildLine discussion forums every month. Mr Liver said: 'The Government recently proposed plans for children aged 11 upwards to be taught about rape and sexual consent as part of PSHE in schools.

The former Ajax captain who signed for £6million in the summer will miss the remaining ten games, having only made two appearances for the entire season. The Newcastle boss assured the De Jong that he wouldn't be rushed back from such a serious injury. Siem de Jong will miss the rest of the campaign and return for pre-season after suffering a collapsed lung . He said: 'Siem will be back in pre-season. It is one of those we just need to test the water with and see how he is. I've said from the start there's definitely no pressure on him.' Brought in by the cub to add some class and technical ability, the Dutchman managed only one start before suffering a serious thigh injury. De Jong's capture was seen as somewhat of a coup by the club and very much whetted the appetite of the Newcastle fans. But a series of injuries and bad luck have seen the supporters disappointed, with many labeling the club vice-captain a flop. The Dutchman (left) suffered a major setback after being set to return from a serious thigh injury . John Carver (right) is disappointed he won't be able to use De Jong but says the club will be patient with him .

Dr Beers believes this was an intended attack and the incident is being investigated by animal welfare. A cat is surprisingly recovering well after having an arrow shot in her eye which went through her skull . The young female cat was taken to the Maunkau After Hours Veterinary Clinic . She was brought into an Auckland vet clinic late last night with a metal arrow 'quite deeply imbedded' in her right eye, veterinarian Dr Jess Beer said . The young female cat was rushed to the Maunkau After Hours Veterinary Clinic when her owners discovered her with a metal arrow in her eye when she came back to their Howick home, east of Auckland. 'The bolt came out with no major complications and fingers crossed, we are actually hoping that eye will be saved,' Dr Beer told 3 News. 'It was directly in her eye, someone was aiming for her head, so I can't imagine this being an accident. 'Unfortunately, there are some people who consider cats a nuisance and I would hate to think this is the outcome of those sorts of attitudes.' Dr Beers believes this was a deliberate attack and the incident is being investigated by animal welfare . Dr Beer says she will find a new home for the cat once she makes a recovery from surgery . Dr Beer says she will be monitoring the cat for 10 days before making a decision on whether the injured pet can undergo a second surgery to take out its wounded eye. The attack is being investigated by Auckland SPCA, who are appealing for information into the incident. Chief executive Chris Kalin told 3 News there has been two other similar cases in the area in recent years. The clinic had to perform the surgery for free as the cat's owners could not afford to pay the medical bills.

According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, all but one of the hostages were among the at least 220 Assyrians captured on February 23 during an attack on villages in the northern Syrian province of al-Hasakah. The Syrian Observatory had said previously that a self-proclaimed ISIS court ordered the release of 29 Assyrian Christian hostages, citing an Assyrian commander. The reasoning behind the release was not immediately clear. It was also not clear why only 19 people were let go Sunday. The \"court\" told the commander that the fate of the other kidnapped Assyrians has yet to be decided by ISIS Sharia jurists. When the decision was announced that at least some of the hostages would be released, Graeme Wood, with The Atlantic, said he was pleased to hear about it, but not entirely surprised. \"ISIS has claimed for a long time to follow rules, and it claims that these Sharia courts will impose limits,\" he told CNN. \"They can attempt to get credibility by showing that they follow rules and that they have some kind of transparent process that follows their particular implementation of Sharia law.\" Also this weekend, the Syrian Observatory reported that ISIS has killed 1,969 people, since the declaration of its \"caliphate\" last June. Nearly two-thirds of them -- 1,238 people -- were civilians. Six were children and eight were women, the group said. Of the rest, 95 were fighters from the al Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra Front, the Syrian Observatory said, and 511 were officers and soldiers of regime forces. ISIS also executed 125 of its own members for \"exceeding the limits in religion,\" the Syrian Observatory said. \"We in SOHR believe that the real number of people that had been killed by (ISIS) is higher than the number documented by SOHR because there are hundreds of missing and detainees inside the (ISIS) jails, loss of communication with about 1,000 men of al-Shaitaat tribe, (and) dozens of Kurds who have still been missing\" since ISIS attacked the Syrian town of Kobani in September.

Labour’s Tristram Hunt allegedly made the remark during a Parliamentary debate last week. Mrs Morgan raised the comment when asked about sexism in Parliament in an interview to mark International Women’s Day. Nicky Morgan today claimed she was condescendingly called 'love' in the House of Commons by her Labour opposite number Tristram Hunt . A Tory source said of shadow education secretary Mr Hunt last night: ‘He ought to think what sort of message it sends to young girls in the classroom to see him use chauvinist put- downs to one of the most senior women in government.’ In the interview with Sky News, Mrs Morgan also defended David Cameron against accusations of sexism, calling him a ‘feminist’. Mr Cameron came under fire in April 2011 after he responded to heckling from Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle by saying: ‘Calm down, dear.’ He later said he was ‘hugely sorry’ for the remark, which was taken from a TV advert. Mrs Morgan denied that the comment showed the PM was an ‘innate sexist’ and said he has a better record promoting women than the Lib Dems – pointing out there are no Lib Dem women in the Cabinet. Nicky Morgan said Tristram Hunt made the remark 'in the heat of the moment' during a fiery Commons debate on schools . She added: ‘I have to say the shadow education secretary said to me last week in education questions “Not my responsibility, love”. ‘I’m afraid to say there can be things that are said in the heat of the moment on all sides of the house.’ The heckle is thought to have come as Mrs Morgan confronted Labour over its tuition fees policy. Higher education fees are strictly a matter for shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, not Mr Hunt. Mrs Morgan also revealed she did not find the Commons chamber during Prime Minister’s Questions intimidating. She added: ‘Prime Minister’s Questions is a tiny part of the week... The work we do in our constituencies, our surgeries, helping people, making the case for our areas to government, that is something women are absolutely brilliant at doing. ‘The tone of the debate when you get women ... is very different.

It is the fifth portrait of the British monarch to be used on coins during her 63-year reign. Production of the new coins began Monday, and they will appear in circulation later this year, the Royal Mint said. The new design depicts the Queen wearing the royal diamond diadem crown from her coronation. Artist Jody Clark said he researched images online when deciding which crown to use. \"I think it's the most familiar and I wanted to make some clear distinctions between the (most recent) portrait by Ian Rank-Broadley FRBS, as Her Majesty really hasn't aged too much in the years since.\" \"FRBS\" refers to Rank-Broadley's fellowship in the Royal British Society of Sculptors, a professional organization that advances the art of sculpture. A panel selected Clark's design from a number by specialist designers across Britain invited to submit anonymous work. The design was then submitted to the British chancellor and the Queen for final approval. Clark is a member of the Royal Mint's team of designers and engravers. He is the first mint engraver to produce a definitive royal coinage portrait in more than a century, the organization said. \"Jody's achievement is something that we can celebrate as a proud moment for The Royal Mint. Capturing a portrait on the surface of a coin demands the utmost skill, and is one of the most challenging disciplines of the coin designer's art,\" chief executive Adam Lawrence said. \"This change of royal portrait will make 2015 a vintage year for UK coins, and it will be hugely exciting for us all to see the new design appear on the coins we use every day.\" Royal coinage portraits are usually updated every 15 to 20 years, the Royal Mint said.

The agency has paid researchers $15,000 (around £10,000) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use in hotel room showers. 'Hotels consume a significant amount of water in the U.S. and around the world,' says a proposal on the EPA's website. The gadget will fit onto hotel shower fixtures and transmit  data back to an accounting system using an app . 'Most hotels do not monitor individual guest water usage and as a result, millions of gallons of potable water are wasted every year by hotel guests.' Which is why they want to create an app to monitor the amount of water hotel guests are using - and, they hope, compel people to shorten their shower time by a minute. The gadget will fit onto existing hotel shower fixtures and transmit water usage data back to a central hotel accounting system using an app, which it is hoped will be doled out in major hotel chains. It will be made up of a flow metre, an embedded system and software, and a resource accounting system, and will allow  hotel guests to monitor their daily water online or using a smartphone app. The EPA has paid researchers $15,000 (around £10,000) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use . The proposal will be marketed to the hotel industry to reduce costs by promoting water conservation among hotel guests. The current average length of shower is estimated to be 8.2 minutes or 17.2 gallons - but it's unknown how hotels will encourage guests to limit this. A spokesperson for the EPA told The Washington Free Beacon that calling for the device was not intended to enable the monitoring of guests shower time. 'It’s ultimately up to hotels to use technology like the monitors being developed at the University of Tulsa. EPA is encouraging creativity with water conservation efforts,' they said.", "completion": "response:\n\nU.S researchers given £10,000 to develop a device to monitor shower use .\nEnvironmental Protection Agency want to save millions of gallons of water .\nIt hopes hotel guest will reduce their shower times by up to one minute ."}

Prior to that Manor were on the brink of selling their assets via an auction, resulting in them being forced to wipe all the hard drives of their computers, so losing valuable data to aid their return. Attempting to rebuild their systems from the ground up has proven time consuming and difficult, and in the end too big a hurdle to overcome, leaving them now to focus on the next race in Malaysia. Lewis Hamilton will start tomorrow's race from pole after qualifying at the front of the pack .

No details have yet emerged as to the contents of the letter referred to by the FIA, or whether the team face any potential sanction.

Johnie doesn't have to answer - the image of her floating contentedly in the bath says it all.
