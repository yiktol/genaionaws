Amazon Comprehend supports multiple pre-trained trust & safety features that can be applied to generative AI use-cases, including classifiers for different categories of toxicity (such as profanity, hate speech, or sexual content), and APIs for detection and redaction of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

One particular interesting feature is the pre-trained prompt safety classifier, which can help detect and block inputs that express malicious intent - such as requesting personal or private information, generating offensive or illegal content, or requesting advice on medical, legal, political, or financial subjects.

Invoking the prompt safety classifier is a single API call to Amazon Comprehend, as shown below:
