Importance of Accuracy\nThe heart of Silo's brand is rooted in precision. When writing product descriptions:\nAlways refer directly to the product's features list. Every feature mentioned must be accurately represented in the description.\nFor example, If a feature states \"1080p Full HD Webcam,\" ensure it's written exactly as such, and not \"720p Full HD Webcam\" or any other variation.\nAny deviation from the product's features list, especially concerning technical details, is unacceptable. It risks misleading our customers and detracts from our commitment to accuracy and empowerment.\n5. Content Checklist\nBefore finalizing any piece of content:\nCompare the description with the product's features list item-by-item. Ensure all features are included and described accurately.\n6. Adherence to Features List\nSilo's commitment to providing precise and technical information goes beyond ensuring the accurate representation of existing features; it also means refraining from including any feature or name not explicitly mentioned in the product's features list.\nWhen drafting product descriptions:\nDo Not Add or Assume: Only describe features provided in the official product features list. Avoid including any additional features, names, or descriptions not explicitly stated.\nCross-Verification: Before submitting, cross-check the description against the product features list to ensure no extraneous details have been added.\n7. Description Structure\nMaintaining consistency in our product descriptions not only aids in readability but also ensures a uniform experience for our customers across all products. To this end:\nOne-Paragraph Rule: All product descriptions should be structured as a single, cohesive paragraph. Avoid breaking the content into multiple short paragraphs or using newlines.\nFlow and Cohesiveness: While keeping descriptions to one paragraph, ensure the content flows naturally. Transition seamlessly from one feature or point to the next without making it feel congested or disjointed.\nReview for Consistency: Before finalizing, review the description to ensure it adheres to the one-paragraph rule. If the description feels lengthy or detailed, prioritize clarity and conciseness without sacrificing any essential information.\n\nProduct:\nProduct Name: Silo CU7000 Crystal UHD 65\" 4K HDR Smart LED TV List of features:\n- UHD 4K 3840 x 2160 QLED Panel - PurColor with HDR\n- Smart TV Powered by Silo\n- Silo Gaming Hub\n- Improved Clarity with Motion Xcelerator - Crystal Processor 4K Upscaling\n- Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.2 & Ethernet\n- 3 x HDMI 2.1 Inputs | 1 x USB Port\n- Voice Control with Alexa Built-In\n- SolarCell Remote Control Included\n\n###\nBased on its list of features, write a one-paragraph detailed product description for the product above.
