    st.markdown("""
    In this game, you'll be presented with various business scenarios.
    Your task is to decide whether machine learning would be an appropriate solution
    for each scenario based on the principles of when to use ML:
    
    - Use ML when you can't code it (complex tasks where deterministic solutions don't suffice)
    - Use ML when you can't scale it (replace repetitive tasks needing human-like expertise)
    - Use ML when you have to adapt/personalize
    - Use ML when you can't track it
    
    Test your knowledge and see if you can make the right decisions!

            ### Key Takeaways:
            
            Remember to use Machine Learning when:
            - Tasks are too complex for explicit programming (image recognition, natural language understanding)
            - You need to scale human-like expertise (recommendations, content moderation)
            - Systems need to adapt and personalize (user preferences, dynamic environments)
            - Problems involve unpredictable environments or complex patterns (autonomous vehicles, fraud detection)
            
            Traditional programming is better when:
            - Problems have clear, unchanging rules (calculations, rule-based workflows)
            - Transparency and auditability are critical (financial calculations, compliance)
            - You have limited data
            - The solution requires perfect accuracy
