Despite 2022 being one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory,\nand with some of our own operating challenges to boot, we still found a way to grow demand (on top of\nthe unprecedented growth we experienced in the first half of the pandemic). We innovated in our largest\nbusinesses to meaningfully improve customer experience short and long term. And, we made important\nadjustments in our investment decisions and the way in which we\u2019ll invent moving forward, while still\npreserving the long-term investments that we believe can change the future of Amazon for customers,\nshareholders, and employees.\nWhile there were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year, the reality is that if you\noperate in large, dynamic, global market segments with many capable and well-funded competitors (the\nconditions in which Amazon operates all of its businesses), conditions rarely stay stagnant for long.\nIn the 25 years I\u2019ve been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of which we\u2019ve initiated ourselves.\nWhen I joined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, did\nnot have a third-party marketplace, and only shipped to addresses in the US. Today, Amazon sells nearly every\nphysical and digital retail item you can imagine, with a vibrant third-party seller ecosystem that accounts\nfor 60% of our unit sales, and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world. Similarly,\nbuilding a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003\nwhen we started pursuing AWS, and still wasn\u2019t when we launched our first services in 2006. Having virtually\nevery book at your fingertips in 60 seconds, and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweight\ndigital reader was not \u201ca thing\u201dyet when we launched Kindle in 2007, nor was a voice-driven personal assistant\nlike Alexa (launched in 2014) that you could use to access entertainment, control your smart home, shop,\nand retrieve all sorts of information.\nThere have also been times when macroeconomic conditions or operating inefficiencies have presented us\nwith new challenges. For instance, in the 2001 dot-com crash, we had to secure letters of credit to buy\ninventory for the holidays, streamline costs to deliver better profitability for the business, yet still prioritized\nthe long-term customer experience and business we were trying to build (if you remember, we actually\nlowered prices in most of our categories during that tenuous 2001 period). Y ou saw this sort of balancing\nagain in 2008-2009 as we endured the recession provoked by the mortgage-backed securities financial crisis.\nWe took several actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of our Stores business, but we also\nbalanced this streamlining with investment in customer experiences that we believed could be substantial\nfuture businesses with strong returns for shareholders. In 2008, AWS was still a fairly small, fledgling business.\nWe knew we were on to something, but it still required substantial capital investment. There were voices\ninside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon (known mostly as an online retailer then) would\nbe investing so much in cloud computing. But, we knew we were inventing something special that could\ncreate a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future. We had a head start on potential competitors;\nand if anything, we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation. We made the long-term decision to\ncontinue investing in AWS. Fifteen years later, AWS is now an $85B annual revenue run rate business, with\nstrong profitability, that has transformed how customers from start-ups to multinational companies to public\nsector organizations manage their technology infrastructure. Amazon would be a different company if\nwe\u2019d slowed investment in AWS during that 2008-2009 period.\nChange is always around the corner. Sometimes, you proactively invite it in, and sometimes it just comes\na-knocking. But, when you see it\u2019s coming, you have to embrace it. And, the companies that do this well over\na long period of time usually succeed. I\u2019m optimistic about our future prospects because I like the way our\nteam is responding to the changes we see in front of us.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4425, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4088809-666c-4822-82c6-ce7054c7dc57": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4088809-666c-4822-82c6-ce7054c7dc57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df48b6a1-93d3-4c71-bbe7-d31df3c2029f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "c2441489074eca81d24a1bd192c1557b9f79e60c7e43a4983846e1e3f1ef1459", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "20b286b9-f254-4345-b676-01113eda22e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "32f439748bd279ccc2f4f029413edfae366b168acca30322166651dc40c37750", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b7f1669-f39c-4b65-a952-aaafba665f78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6081459c296a47fc8e7c71a887558930bdf355b4bb9ab8ee87cba91e0cea6f2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Over the last several months, we took a deep look across the company, business by business , invention by\ninvention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative\u2019s long-term potential to drive\nenough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led to us\nshuttering certain businesses. For instance, we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstores\nand 4 Star stores, closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts, and moved on from some newer\ndevices where we didn\u2019t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that\nweren\u2019t producing the returns we\u2019d hoped (e.g. free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35) and\namended them. We also reprioritized where to spend our resources, which ultimately led to the hard decision\nto eliminate 27,000 corporate roles. There are a number of other changes that we\u2019ve made over the last\nseveral months to streamline our overall costs, and like most leadership teams, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate\nwhat we\u2019re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.\nWe also looked hard at how we were working together as a team and asked our corporate employees to come\nback to the office at least three days a week , beginning in May. During the pandemic, our employees rallied to\nget work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances that\npresented themselves. It was impressive and I\u2019m proud of the way our collective team came together to\novercome unprecedented challenges for our customers, communities, and business. But, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the\nbest long-term approach. We\u2019ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more\neffective when we\u2019re working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing on\none another\u2019s ideas happen more freely, and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthrough\nmoments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, or\ncontinuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate\u2019s office later\nthat day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates.\nSerendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It\u2019s also significantly\neasier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we\u2019re in the office together most of the\ntime and surrounded by our colleagues. Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important\nin our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.\nA critical challenge we\u2019ve continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network (i.e.\nthe cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer)\u2014and we\u2019ve made several changes that we believe will\nmeaningfully improve our fulfillment costs and speed of delivery .\nDuring the early part of the pandemic, with many physical stores shut down, our consumer business grew\nat an extraordinary clip, with annual revenue increasing from $245B in 2019 to $434B in 2022. This meant that\nwe had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we\u2019d built over the prior 25 years and substantially\naccelerate building a last-mile transportation network that\u2019s now the size of UPS (along with a new sortation\ncenter network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances)\u2014all in the\nspan of about two years. This was no easy feat, and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hard\nto make this happen. However, not surprisingly, with that rate and scale of change, there was a lot of\noptimization needed to yield the intended productivity. Over the last several months, we\u2019ve scrutinized every\nprocess path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes and\nmechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters. There\u2019s\nmore work to do, but we\u2019re pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us.\nWe also took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and\nfaster speed for many years to come. A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network was\norganized. Until recently, Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventory\nfrom fulfillment centers spread across the entire country. If a local fulfillment center didn\u2019t have the product a\ncustomer ordered, we\u2019d end up shipping it from other parts of the country, costing us more and increasing\ndelivery times.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4685, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b7f1669-f39c-4b65-a952-aaafba665f78": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b7f1669-f39c-4b65-a952-aaafba665f78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "df48b6a1-93d3-4c71-bbe7-d31df3c2029f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "c2441489074eca81d24a1bd192c1557b9f79e60c7e43a4983846e1e3f1ef1459", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e4088809-666c-4822-82c6-ce7054c7dc57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "22bce16f82fb336d5169167290ef4086c4a0b540d5227cbad38b0b1774990c01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "078ba292-994f-4054-a500-71ac7f81934f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5703be83b65b182ce5b3212cfe09f308b1d289fe39b3ecd1f0ce0b2bdfeaf642", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Over the last several months, we\u2019ve scrutinized every\nprocess path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes and\nmechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters.

This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds of\nadditional nodes over the last few years, distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the\ncomplexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently. Last year, we started\nrearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to move\nfrom a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model.

We also continue\nto improve our advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict what customers in various parts of the\ncountry will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time. We\u2019ve recently\ncompleted this regional roll out and like the early results. Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve,\nless impact on the environment, and customers getting their orders faster. On the latter, we\u2019re excited about\nseeing more next day and same-day deliveries, and we\u2019re on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds\never in 2023. Overall, we remain confident about our plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and build a\nmeaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins.\nAWS has an $85B annualized revenue run rate, is still early in its adoption curve, but at a juncture where it\u2019s\ncritical to stay focused on what matters most to customers over the long-haul . Despite growing 29% year-over-\nyear (\u201cY oY\u201d) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies\nare being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some\ncompanies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight\ntimes, it\u2019s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we\u2019re taking a different\ntack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can\nseamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity\nand cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn\u2019t exist when you\u2019ve already made\nexpensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS,\nlike all our businesses, we\u2019re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We\u2019re trying to build customer\nrelationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are\nspending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this\nuncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they\u2019re not cost-cutting as much as cost-\noptimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer\nexperiences they\u2019re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and\nwe think it\u2019ll bode well for both customers and AWS.\nWhile these short-term headwinds soften our growth rate, we like a lot of the fundamentals that we\u2019re seeing\nin AWS. Our new customer pipeline is robust, as are our active migrations. Many companies use\ndiscontinuous periods like this to step back and determine what they strategically want to change, and we\nfind an increasing number of enterprises opting out of managing their own infrastructure, and preferring to\nmove to AWS to enjoy the agility, innovation, cost-efficiency, and security benefits. And most importantly\nfor customers, AWS continues to deliver new capabilities rapidly (over 3,300 new features and services launched\nin 2022), and invest in long-term inventions that change what\u2019s possible.\nChip development is a good example. In last year\u2019s letter, I mentioned the investment we were making in our\ngeneral-purpose CPU processors named Graviton. Graviton2-based compute instances deliver up to 40%\nbetter price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86-based instances; and in 2022, we delivered\nour Graviton3 chips, providing 25% better performance than the Graviton2 processors. Further, as machine\nlearning adoption has continued to accelerate, customers have yearned for lower-cost GPUs (the chips\nmost commonly used for machine learning). AWS started investing years ago in these specialized chips for\nmachine learning training and inference (inferences are the predictions or answers that a machine learning\nmodel provides). We delivered our first training chip in 2022 (\u201cTrainium\u201d); and for the most common\nmachine learning models, Trainium-based instances are up to 140% faster than GPU-based instances at up\nto 70% lower cost. Most companies are still in the training stage, but as they develop models that graduate to\nlarge-scale production, they\u2019ll find that most of the cost is in inference because models are trained\nperiodically whereas inferences are happening all the time as their associated application is being exercised.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4550, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08d9f49b-cb1b-4b6e-a76e-6f49b8ea22b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "08d9f49b-cb1b-4b6e-a76e-6f49b8ea22b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4eff8023-81b5-4bd2-9be7-7afff9cc6191", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "d02cd043654f51126544dc68b7cc8246c60f556b63e195cbfa365b1f9bb73922", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "078ba292-994f-4054-a500-71ac7f81934f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "e67cf5df0cc21cb3dceffe137be829bdfb50942f614e0d6b516a57fcd1f6fe38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "35a96023-eeea-4d5d-b0f4-8364c8f1f9d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "600d65f4ea82775c4875e4079bd63e981f485e0ccff6c95961a3e1180a839626", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Further, as machine\nlearning adoption has continued to accelerate, customers have yearned for lower-cost GPUs (the chips\nmost commonly used for machine learning).

However, unlike physical retailers, Amazon\ncan tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we know\nabout shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms. This leads to\nadvertising that\u2019s more useful for customers; and as a result, performs better for brands. This is part of why\nour Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly (23% Y oY in Q4 2022, 25% Y oY overall for 2022\non a $31B revenue base), even as most large advertising-focused businesses\u2019 growth have slowed over the last\nseveral quarters.\nWe strive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands. We have near and long-term opportunities\nthat will help us achieve that mission. We\u2019re continuing to make large investments in machine learning to\nkeep honing our advertising selection algorithms. For the past couple of years, we\u2019ve invested in building\ncomprehensive, flexible, and durable planning and measurement solutions, giving marketers greater insight\ninto advertising effectiveness. An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud (\u201cAMC\u201d). AMC is a \u201cclean room\u201d\n(i.e. secure digital environment) in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analytics\nacross a range of first and third-party inputs, in a privacy-safe manner, to generate advertising and business\ninsights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies. The Advertising and AWS teams have\ncollaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS, operate securely in AMC with Amazon and\nother third-party data sources, perform analytics in AWS, and have the option to activate advertising on\nAmazon or third-party publishers through the Amazon Demand-Side Platform. Customers really like this\nconcerted capability. We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video,\nlive sports, audio, and grocery products. We\u2019ll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage with\nthe right audience, and grow this part of our business.\nWhile it\u2019s tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses, to build a sustainable,\nlong-lasting, growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions, you can\u2019t stop\ninventing and working on long-term customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers and\nyour company.\nWhen we look at new investment opportunities, we ask ourselves a few questions:\n\u25e6If we were successful, could it be big and have a reasonable return on invested capital?\n\u25e6Is the opportunity being well-served today?\n\u25e6Do we have a differentiated approach?\n\u25e6And, do we have competence in that area? And if not, can we acquire it quickly?\nIf we like the answers to those questions, then we\u2019ll invest. This process has led to some expansions that\nseem straightforward, and others that some folks might not have initially guessed.\nThe earliest example is when we chose to expand from just selling Books , to adding categories like Music,\nVideo, Electronics, and Toys. Back then (1998-1999), it wasn\u2019t universally applauded, but in retrospect, it\nseems fairly obvious.\nThe same could be said for our international Stores expansion . In 2022, our international consumer segment\ndrove $118B of revenue. In our larger, established international consumer businesses, we\u2019re big enough to\nbe impacted by the slowing macroeconomic conditions; however, the growth in 2019-2021 on a large base was\nremarkable\u201430% compound annual growth rate (\u201cCAGR\u201d) in the UK, 26% in Germany, and 21% in\nJapan (excluding the impact of FX). Over the past several years, we\u2019ve invested in new international\ngeographies, including India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, various European countries, the Middle East, and\nparts of Africa. These new countries take a certain amount of fixed investment to get started and to scale, but\nwe like the trajectory they\u2019re on, and their growth patterns resemble what we\u2019ve seen in North America\nand our established international geographies. Emerging countries sometimes lack some of the infrastructure\nand services that our business relies on (e.g. payment methods, transportation services, and internet/\ntelecom infrastructure). To solve these challenges, we continue to work with various partners to deliver\nsolutions for customers. Ultimately, we believe that this investment in serving a broader geographical footprint\nwill allow us to help more customers across the world, as well as build a larger free cash flow-generating\nconsumer business.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4542, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b83770de-f98b-4962-8369-f4399c1dfc37": {"__data__": {"id_": "b83770de-f98b-4962-8369-f4399c1dfc37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cd09977b-b1b6-49a0-9839-1aee1e155747", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "9ad34daf8e9e27ca26b28c9bcaf5a0fafeaf5b1bedd0791012f1df814318108e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35a96023-eeea-4d5d-b0f4-8364c8f1f9d3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_path": "/mnt/g/My Drive/LOCAL/genaionaws/02-PromptEngineering/data/2022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 83535, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "7ddb9ad5bd452869d521a24812212b631d1b81104f5511f8785028c753fc7a62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "46883f68-c94b-4313-ae0d-cb0918671b69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cc232ccc8b17b30d3a6d7ad106f2943b2507b481035d56c578b280ac4b0c8e1a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Beyond geographic expansion, we\u2019ve been working to expand our customer offerings across some large,\nunique product retail market segments. Grocery is an $800B market segment in the US alone, with the average\nhousehold shopping three to four times per week. Amazon has built a somewhat unusual, but significant\ngrocery business over nearly 20 years. Similar to how other mass merchants entered the grocery space in the\n1980s, we began by adding products typically found in supermarket aisles that don\u2019t require temperature\ncontrol such as paper products, canned and boxed food, candy and snacks, pet care, health and personal care,\nand beauty. However, we offer more than three million items compared to a typical supermarket\u2019s 30K for\nthe same categories. To date, we\u2019ve also focused on larger pack sizes, given the current cost to serve online\ndelivery. While we\u2019re pleased with the size and growth of our grocery business, we aspire to serve more of\nour customers\u2019 grocery needs than we do today. To do so, we need a broader physical store footprint given that\nmost of the grocery shopping still happens in physical venues. Whole Foods Market pioneered the natural\nand organic specialty grocery store concept 40 years ago. Today, it\u2019s a large and growing business that continues\nto raise the bar for healthy and sustainable food. Over the past year, we\u2019ve continued to invest in the\nbusiness while also making changes to drive better profitability. Whole Foods is on an encouraging path,\nbut to have a larger impact on physical grocery, we must find a mass grocery format that we believe is worth\nexpanding broadly. Amazon Fresh is the brand we\u2019ve been experimenting with for a few years, and we\u2019re\nworking hard to identify and build the right mass grocery format for Amazon scale. Grocery is a big growth\nopportunity for Amazon.\nAmazon Business is another example of an investment where our ecommerce and logistics capabilities\nposition us well to pursue this large market segment. Amazon Business allows businesses, municipalities,\nand organizations to procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at great savings.\nWhile some areas of the economy have struggled over the past few years, Amazon Business has thrived. Why?\nBecause the team has translated what it means to deliver selection, value, and convenience into a business\nprocurement setting, constantly listening to and learning from customers, and innovating on their behalf.\nSome people have never heard of Amazon Business, but, our business customers love it. Amazon Business\nlaunched in 2015 and today drives roughly $35B in annualized gross sales. More than six million active\ncustomers, including 96 of the global Fortune 100 companies, are enjoying Amazon Business\u2019 one-stop\nshopping, real-time analytics, and broad selection on hundreds of millions of business supplies. We believe\nthat we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what\u2019s possible to date, and plan to keep building the features our\nbusiness customers tell us they need and want.\nWhile many brands and merchants successfully sell their products on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, there are also\na large number of brands and sellers who have launched their own direct-to-consumer websites. One of the\nchallenges for these merchants is driving conversion from views to purchases. We invented Buy with Prime\nto help with this challenge. Buy with Prime allows third-party brands and sellers to offer their products on\ntheir own websites to our large Amazon Prime membership, and offer those customers fast, free Prime shipping\nand seamless checkout with their Amazon account. Buy with Prime provides merchants several additional\nbenefits, including Amazon handling the product storage, picking, packing, delivery, payment, and any\nreturns, all through Amazon Pay and Fulfillment by Amazon. Buy with Prime has recently been made\navailable to all US merchants; and so far, Buy with Prime has increased shopper conversion on third-party\nshopping sites by 25% on average.

However, our customers\nhave continued to express a strong desire for Amazon to provide a better alternative to the inefficient and\nunsatisfying broader healthcare experience. We decided to start with primary care as it\u2019s a prevalent first stop\nin the patient journey. We evaluated and studied the existing landscape extensively, including some early\nAmazon experiments like Amazon Care. During this process, we identified One Medical\u2019s patient-focused\nexperience as an excellent foundation upon which to build our future business; and in July 2022, we announced\nour acquisition of One Medical. There are several elements that customers love about One Medical. It has\na fantastic digital app that makes it easy for patients to discuss issues with a medical practitioner via chat or\nvideo conference. If a physical visit is required, One Medical has offices in cities across the US where\npatients can book same or next day appointments. One Medical has relationships with specialty physicians\nin each of its cities and works closely with local hospital systems to make seeing specialists easy, so One\nMedical members can quickly access these resources when needed. Going forward, we strongly believe\nthat One Medical and Amazon will continue to innovate together to change what primary care will look like\nfor customers.\nKuiper is another example of Amazon innovating for customers over the long term in an area where there\u2019s\nhigh customer need. Our vision for Kuiper is to create a low-Earth orbit satellite system to deliver high-quality\nbroadband internet service to places around the world that don\u2019t currently have it. There are hundreds of\nmillions of households and businesses who don\u2019t have reliable access to the internet. Imagine what they\u2019ll be\nable to do with reliable connectivity, from people taking online education courses, using financial services,\nstarting their own businesses, doing their shopping, enjoying entertainment, to businesses and governments\nimproving their coverage, efficiency, and operations. Kuiper will deliver not only accessibility, but\naffordability. Our teams have developed low-cost antennas (i.e. customer terminals) that will lower the\nbarriers to access. We recently unveiled the new terminals that will communicate with the satellites passing\noverhead, and we expect to be able to produce our standard residential version for less than $400 each. They\u2019re\nsmall: 11 inches square, 1 inch thick, and weigh less than 5 pounds without their mounting bracket, but\nthey deliver speeds up to 400 megabits per second. And they\u2019re powered by Amazon-designed baseband chips.\nWe\u2019re preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications network\nthis year, and plan to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024. The customer reaction to what we\u2019ve\nshared thus far about Kuiper has been very positive, and we believe Kuiper represents a very large potential\nopportunity for Amazon. It also shares several similarities to AWS in that it\u2019s capital intensive at the start,\nbut has a large prospective consumer, enterprise, and government customer base, significant revenue and\noperating profit potential, and relatively few companies with the technical and inventive aptitude, as well as\nthe investment hypothesis to go after it.\nOne final investment area that I\u2019ll mention, that\u2019s core to setting Amazon up to invent in every area of our\nbusiness for many decades to come, and where we\u2019re investing heavily is Large Language Models (\u201cLLMs\u201d)\nand Generative AI . Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades, but it\u2019s\nonly been the last five to ten years that it\u2019s started to be used more pervasively by companies.
