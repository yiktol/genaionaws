st.markdown("""The academic definition of embedding is translating high-dimensional vectors into a relatively low-dimensional space. \
You might know each and every word in this sentence but still have no idea about the whole sentence. \
We can think of embedding as converting natural language into a sequence of numbers, \
with the input being a piece of text and the output being a vector. \
In other words, the vector is a numerical representation of the text, \
making it easy to perform all kinds of complex computations in AI/ML.""")
